# Frontend UI and Security Tests Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of frontend UI components and comprehensive security tests for the Smart AI Hub project, as specified in the `kilocode_complete_frontend_tests.md` file.

## Security Tests Implementation

### 1. Visibility Rules Tests
- **File**: `tests/security/visibility.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests user visibility rules for all tier combinations
- **Coverage**:
  - Administrator visibility (can see all users)
  - Agency visibility (can see organizations, admins, and generals under them)
  - Organization visibility (can see admins and generals in their organization)
  - Admin visibility (can see generals and other admins in same organization)
  - General visibility (can only see themselves)

### 2. Transfer Authorization Tests
- **File**: `tests/security/transfer.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests transfer authorization with visibility checks
- **Coverage**:
  - Valid transfers between hierarchy levels
  - Invalid transfers to users not visible
  - Transfers with insufficient balance
  - Transaction atomicity and rollback on errors

### 3. Referral System Tests
- **File**: `tests/security/referral.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests referral system security
- **Coverage**:
  - Self-referral prevention
  - Agency referral rewards deduction from balance
  - No rewards when agency has insufficient balance

### 4. Block System Tests
- **File**: `tests/security/block.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests block/unblock authorization
- **Coverage**:
  - Agency can block organizations
  - General users cannot block anyone
  - Blocked users cannot login or use API

### 5. Audit Logging Tests
- **File**: `tests/security/audit.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests audit logging for critical operations
- **Coverage**:
  - Logging of all transfer operations
  - Logging of all block operations
  - Logging of unauthorized access attempts

## Frontend Components Implementation

### 1. Points & Credits Dashboard
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/points/PointsCreditsDashboard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Display points and credits balance
  - Exchange credits to points
  - Purchase points with payment integration
  - Claim daily rewards
  - View exchange rates

### 2. Transfer Form
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/transfer/TransferForm.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Transfer points or credits to visible users
  - User selection filtered by visibility rules
  - Transfer amount validation
  - Optional transfer notes

### 3. Member List
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/MemberList.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Display list of visible members
  - Show user tier, points, credits, and status
  - Block/unblock functionality based on user tier
  - Pagination support

### 4. Referral Card
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/referral/ReferralCard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Display referral statistics
  - Show invite code and link
  - Copy invite link functionality
  - QR code generation for easy sharing

### 5. Route Guard
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/guards/RouteGuard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Protect routes based on user tier
  - Redirect unauthorized users
  - Loading state handling

### 6. Authentication Hook
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Authentication state management
  - Login, logout, and register functions
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - User context provider

## Pages with Access Control

### 1. Members Page
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/pages/members/MembersPage.tsx`
- **Access**: Administrator, Agency, Organization, Admin
- **Features**: Protected members list with proper access control

### 2. Transfer Page
- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/pages/transfer/TransferPage.tsx`
- **Access**: All authenticated users
- **Features**: Transfer form with visibility-based user selection

## E2E Tests Implementation

### Hierarchy Tests
- **File**: `tests/e2e/hierarchy.spec.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - General user access restrictions
  - Agency user permissions
  - Transfer flow functionality
  - Points dashboard display
  - Referral card functionality

## Configuration Files

### 1. Jest Configuration
- **File**: `jest.config.js`
- **Purpose**: Unit test configuration for security tests

### 2. Playwright Configuration
- **File**: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Purpose**: E2E test configuration with multiple browsers

### 3. Test Setup
- **File**: `tests/setup.ts`
- **Purpose**: Global test utilities and mocking
