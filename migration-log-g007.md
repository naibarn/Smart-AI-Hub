- **Status**: Completed

## Source Files

1. `specs/02_architecture/services/api_gateway.md`
   - File size: 569 lines
   - Content: API Gateway service specification
   - Key features: Request routing, authentication verification, rate limiting, CORS handling

2. `specs/02_architecture/services/core_service.md`
   - File size: 703 lines
   - Content: Core Service specification
   - Key features: User management, RBAC, credit accounting, usage analytics

## Generated Files

1. `specs/007-infrastructure/spec.md`
   - Merged specification combining both API Gateway and Core Service
   - Enhanced with proper metadata and structure
   - Added comprehensive business logic documentation
   - Included security features and performance optimizations

2. `specs/007-infrastructure/contracts/api-spec.json`
   - OpenAPI 3.0 specification for Infrastructure Services
   - Defined endpoints for credit management and health checks
   - Included proper request/response schemas
   - Added security schemes and error responses

3. `specs/007-infrastructure/data-model.md`
   - Comprehensive data model documentation
   - Prisma schema definitions for all related models
   - Data access patterns and business logic examples
   - Database indexes and validation rules

## Backup Location

- **Backup Directory**: `specs/_backup/20250115/g007-infrastructure/`
- **Files Backed Up**:
  - `api_gateway.md`
  - `core_service.md`

## Key Enhancements

1. **Unified Specification**: Combined API Gateway and Core Service into a cohesive infrastructure specification
2. **Standardized Structure**: Applied consistent formatting and metadata
3. **Enhanced API Documentation**: Created comprehensive OpenAPI specification
4. **Detailed Data Models**: Documented all database schemas with relationships
5. **Business Logic Examples**: Added code examples for credit operations and user management
6. **Security Documentation**: Consolidated security features from both services

## Content Merged

### From API Gateway

- Request routing rules and proxy configuration
- Rate limiting implementation with role-based limits
- Security features including JWT validation and CORS handling
- Monitoring and health check endpoints

### From Core Service

- User management and role-based access control
- Credit account management and transaction processing
- Usage analytics and promotional code system
- Database schema and business logic

### Additional Enhancements

- Added comprehensive error handling documentation
- Included performance optimization strategies
- Documented integration points with other services
- Added deployment and monitoring requirements

## Issues Resolved

1. **No conflicts found** between the source files
2. **Complementary functionality** between API Gateway and Core Service
3. **Consistent technology stack** (Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript)
4. **Aligned database models** and data access patterns

## Validation

- ✅ All source files successfully merged
- ✅ Generated specification follows standard format
- ✅ API specification is valid OpenAPI 3.0
- ✅ Data models are properly documented
- ✅ Backup created successfully
- ✅ No content conflicts encountered

## Next Steps

1. Review the merged specification for completeness
2. Validate API endpoints with development team
3. Update service implementations to match new specification
4. Remove original files from old structure after validation period
5. Update documentation references to point to new location

## Notes

- The Infrastructure Services specification serves as the foundation for the platform's core functionality
- Both API Gateway and Core Service are tightly integrated and share common data models
- The merged specification provides a comprehensive view of the platform's infrastructure layer
- Consider this specification as EPIC-level documentation that may spawn multiple feature specifications
