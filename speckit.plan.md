## Technical Implementation Strategies

### 1. Microservices Communication

**Current State**: HTTP-based communication via API Gateway  
**Strategy**: Enhance with event-driven architecture for Phase 2

```typescript
// Current: Direct HTTP calls
const response = await axios.post('http://auth-service/validate', data);

// Future: Event-driven
await eventBus.publish('user.auth.request', { userId, token });
```

### 2. Database Strategy

**Current State**: Two separate Prisma schemas  
**Strategy**: Unify schemas and implement read replicas

```sql
-- Implement read replica for queries
CREATE USER replica_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE smart_ai_hub TO replica_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO replica_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO replica_user;
```

### 3. Caching Strategy

**Current State**: Redis for sessions and basic caching  
**Strategy**: Implement multi-layer caching

```typescript
// L1: In-memory cache
const memoryCache = new Map();

// L2: Redis cache
await redis.setex(`user:${userId}`, 300, userData);

// L3: Database
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
```

### 4. Security Implementation

**Current State**: Basic JWT auth with RBAC  
**Strategy**: Enhance with advanced security

```typescript
// Rate limiting per user
const rateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests
  keyGenerator: (req) => req.user?.id || req.ip,
});

// API key rotation
const rotateApiKey = async (userId: string) => {
  const newKey = generateSecureKey();
  await updateApiKey(userId, newKey);
  return newKey;
};
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Items

1. **Payment Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Stripe integration issues, webhook failures
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - Use test mode extensively
     - Implement idempotency keys
     - Create webhook retry mechanism
     - Manual payment reconciliation

2. **Third-Party API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk**: OpenAI/Claude rate limiting
   - **Mitigation**:

     - Use exponential backoff
     - Provider switching logic
     - Cache common responses

3. **Database Performance**
   - **Risk**: Slow queries under load
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Implement query optimization
     - Add read replicas
     - Use connection pooling
     - Monitor query performance

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Frontend Complexity**
   - **Risk**: UI development delays
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Use component library (MUI)
     - Implement responsive design early
     - Create reusable components
     - User testing throughout

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - **Risk**: Insufficient test coverage
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Test-driven development for new features
