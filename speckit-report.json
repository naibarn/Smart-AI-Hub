prefix: 'rl:',\r\n  }),\r\n  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute\r\n  max: async (req) => {\r\n    const user = req.user;\r\n    if (!user) return 10; // Guest\r\n\r\n    switch (user.role) {\r\n      case 'admin':\r\n        return Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;\r\n      case 'manager':\r\n        return 120;\r\n      case 'user':\r\n        return 60;\r\n      default:\r\n        return 10;\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  standardHeaders: true,\r\n  legacyHeaders: false,\r\n  message: {\r\n    code: 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED',\r\n    message: 'Too many requests, try again later',\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proxy Configuration\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst proxyConfig = {\r\n  '/api/auth': {\r\n    target: 'http://auth-service:3001',\r\n    changeOrigin: true,\r\n    pathRewrite: { '^/api/auth': '' },\r\n  },\r\n  '/api/users': {\r\n    target: 'http://core-service:3002',\r\n    changeOrigin: true,\r\n  },\r\n  '/api/mcp': {\r\n    target:

It serves as the bridge between the Smart AI Hub platform and external AI services.\r\n\r\n## Technology Stack\r\n\r\n- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 LTS\r\n- **Framework**: Express.js 4.x\r\n- **Port**: 3003\r\n- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x\r\n- **WebSocket**: ws library\r\n- **Queue**: BullMQ for request management\r\n- **Circuit Breaker**: opossum for fault tolerance\r\n\r\n## Responsibilities\r\n\r\n1. **LLM Provider Integration**: Connect with OpenAI, Claude, and other providers\r\n2. **WebSocket Real-time Communication**: Handle streaming responses\r\n3. **Request/Response Transformation**: Convert between platform and provider formats\r\n4. **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitor and log usage for billing\r\n5. **Provider Fallback Logic**: Switch providers when one fails\r\n6. **Sora2 Video Generator API Integration**: Handle video generation requests\r\n7. **Custom GPT Integration**: Enhanced video generation workflows\r\n\r\n## Components\r\n\r\n- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time bidirectional communication\r\n- **OpenAI Client Wrapper**: OpenAI API integration\r\n- **Anthropic Client Wrapper**: Claude API integration\r\n- **Request Queue**: BullMQ for managing request processing\r\n- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for provider failures\r\n\r\n## Workflow\r\n\r\n1. Validate JWT & check credits\r\n2. Route to appropriate LLM provider\r\n3. Transform request to provider format\r\n4. Send request with retry logic\r\n5. Stream response via WebSocket\r\n6. Log usage & deduct credits\r\n\r\n## WebSocket Protocol\r\n\r\n### Client → Server\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface MCPRequest {\r\n  id: string;\r\n  type: 'completion' | 'chat' | 'embedding';\r\n  provider: 'openai' | 'claude' | 'auto';\r\n  model: string;\r\n  messages?: Message[];\r\n  prompt?: string;\r\n  stream: boolean;\r\n  maxTokens?: number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Server → Client

5. ข้อกำหนดทางเทคนิค (Technical Requirements)\n\n### 5.1 Agent Execution Methods\n\nระบบรองรับการเรียกใช้ Agent Flow หลายวิธีเพื่อความยืดหยุ่นและรองรับการพัฒนาในอนาคต:\n\n#### แนวทางที่แนะนำ: Hybrid Approach (MCP + Direct API)\n\nใช้ **MCP Server** เป็น orchestration layer หลัก ร่วมกับ **Direct OpenAI API** สำหรับ execution และมี **REST API** เป็น fallback option\n\n**สถาปัตยกรรม:**\n```\nFrontend/App\n    ↓\nMCP Server (WebSocket)\n  - Authentication & Authorization\n  - Credit Validation & Deduction\n  - Agent Flow Orchestration\n  - Usage Logging & Analytics\n    ↓\nOpenAI API (Direct) / Claude API / Custom APIs\n```\n\n**วิธีการที่รองรับ:**\n\n| Method | Protocol | Use Case | Priority |\n|--------|----------|----------|----------|\n| **MCP (WebSocket)** | WebSocket | Real-time agents, streaming, interactive flows | Primary |\n| **REST API** | HTTP/REST | Simple agents, batch processing, external integrations | Secondary |\n| **Direct OpenAI** | OpenAI SDK | OpenAI-specific features (Assistants API, Vision, Tools) | Backend |\n| **Serverless** | Cloud Run/Functions | Background jobs, scheduled tasks, resource-intensive agents | Future |\n\n**Execution Configuration:**\n\nแต่ละ Agent สามารถกำหนด execution config ได้:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentExecutionConfig {\n  method: 'mcp' | 'rest' | 'direct' | 'serverless';\n  provider: 'openai' | 'claude' | 'auto';\n  streaming: boolean;\n  timeout: number; // milliseconds\n  retryPolicy?: {\n    maxRetries: number;\n    backoff: 'exponential' | 'linear';\n  };\n  webhookUrl?: string; // for async execution\n}\n```\n\n**ข้อดีของแนวทาง Hybrid:**\n- ใช้ประโยชน์จาก MCP Server ที่มีอยู่แล้ว (authentication, credits, logging)\n- รองรับ real-time streaming และ WebSocket\n- ยืดหยุ่นรองรับ OpenAI features ใหม่ๆ\n- รองรับ multi-provider (OpenAI, Claude, custom)\n- มี REST API fallback สำหรับความเข้ากันได้\n\n### 5.2 Database Schema\n\n**ตารางใหม่: `Agent`**\n- `id`: `String` (Primary Key, e.g., `cuid()`)\n- `name`: `String`\n- `description`: `String` (คำอธิบายสั้นๆ)\n- `longDescription`: `String?` (คำอธิบายแบบยาว รองรับ Markdown)\n- `flowDefinition`: `Json` (เก็บโครงสร้างของ Agent Flow ในรูปแบบ YAML/JSON)\n- `inputSchema`: `Json` (ระบุ Schema ของ Input ที่ Agent ต้องการ)\n- `exampleInput`: `Json?` (ตัวอย่าง Input)\n- `exampleOutput`: `String?` (ตัวอย่าง Output)\n- `executionConfig`: `Json` (กำหนดวิธีการ execute Agent - method, provider, streaming, timeout)\n- `category`: `String` (หมวดหมู่ของ Agent เช่น \"Finance\", \"Marketing\", \"Development\")\n- `iconUrl`: `String?` (URL ของไอคอน Agent)\n- **`previewImages`: `String[]`** (Array ของ URL รูปภาพ preview)\n- **`videoUrl`: `String?`** (YouTube video URL สำหรับ demo/tutorial)\n- `tags`: `String[]` (Array ของ tags สำหรับการค้นหา)\n- **`type`: `Enum` (`AGENT_FLOW`, `CUSTOM_GPT`, `GEMINI_GEM`)** - ประเภทของ Agent\n- **`externalUrl`: `String?`** - URL สำหรับ Custom GPT หรือ Gemini Gem\n- **`visibility`: `Enum` (`PRIVATE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `AGENCY`, `PUBLIC`)** - กำหนดสิทธิ์การมองเห็น\n- **`status`: `Enum` (`DRAFT`, `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`)** - สถานะการ approve\n- **`createdBy`: `String` (Foreign Key to `User`)** - ผู้สร้าง Agent\n- **`organizationId`: `String?` (Foreign Key to `Organization`)** - หากเป็น Agent ของ Organization\n- **`agencyId`: `String?` (Foreign Key to `Agency`)** - หากเป็น Agent ของ Agency\n- **`approvedBy`: `String?` (Foreign Key to `User`)** - Admin ที่ approve\n- **`approvedAt`: `DateTime?`** - วันที่ approve\n- **`rejectionReason`: `String?`** - เหตุผลการ reject\n- `isActive`: `Boolean` (Default: `true`) - สามารถ disable Agent ได้โดยไร้ได้ delete\n- `createdAt`: `DateTime`\n- `updatedAt`: `DateTime`\n\n**ตารางใหม่: `AgentSetting`**\n- `id`: `String` (Primary Key)\n- `key`: `String` (Unique, e.g., `\"openai_markup_percentage\"`)\n- `value`: `String`\n- `updatedAt`: `DateTime`\n\n**ตารางใหม่: `AgentApprovalLog`**\n- `id`: `String` (Primary Key)\n- `agentId`: `String` (Foreign Key to `Agent`)\n- `adminId`: `String` (Foreign Key to `User` - Admin ที่ทำการ approve/reject)\n- `action`: `Enum` (`APPROVED`, `REJECTED`)\n- `reason`: `String?` (เหตุผล สำหรับ reject)\n- `createdAt`: `DateTime`\n\n**ตารางใหม่: `AgentUsageLog`**\n- `id`: `String` (Primary Key)\n- `userId`: `String` (Foreign Key to `User`)\n- `agentId`: `String` (Foreign Key to `Agent`)\n- `promptTokens`: `Int`\n- `completionTokens`: `Int`\n- `totalTokens`: `Int`\n- `baseCostUsd`: `Decimal` (ค่าใช้จ่ายจริงจาก OpenAI)\n- `markupPercentage`: `Decimal`\n- `finalCostUsd`: `Decimal` (ค่าใช้จ่ายหลังบวก Markup)\n- `creditsDeducted`: `Decimal`\n- `isTestMode`: `Boolean` (Default: `false`) - บันทึกว่าเป็นการทดสอบหรือไม่\n- `createdAt`: `DateTime`\n\n**หมายเหตุ:**\n- ตาราง `Organization` และ `Agency` สมมุติว่ามีอยู่แล้วในระบบ Smart AI Hub\n- หากยังไม่มี อาจเพิ่มตารางเหล่านี้ใน Phase 1 และใช้ `organizationId` และ `agencyId` เป็น `null` ไปก่อน\n\n### 5.3 Billing & Markup Logic\n\n1.  **Get Base Cost:** หลังจากรัน Agent และได้รับ Response จาก OpenAI, ดึงค่า `usage.total_tokens` มาคำนวณค่าใช้จ่ายพื้นฐาน (Base Cost) ตามเรตของโมเดลที่ใช้\n    `baseCostUsd = (prompt_tokens * INPUT_RATE_USD) + (completion_tokens * OUTPUT_RATE_USD)`\n\n2.  **Get Markup:** ดึงค่า `openai_markup_percentage` จากตาราง `AgentSetting`\n    `markup = Decimal(setting.value) / 100`\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Cost:**\n    `finalCostUsd = baseCostUsd * (1 + markup)`\n\n4.  **Convert to Credits:** แปลง `finalCostUsd` เป็นจำนวนเครดิตที่จะหัก โดยใช้เรตการแปลงจากระบบ Subscription/Credit ที่มีอยู่\n    `creditsToDeduct = finalCostUsd * getCreditConversionRate()`\n\n5.  **Deduct Credits:** เรียกใช้ฟังก์ชัน `creditService.deduct()` เพื่อหักเครดิตจากบัญชีผู้ใช้\n\n### 5.4 Backend API Endpoints\n\n#### REST API Endpoints\n\nสำหรับ client ที่ไม่รองรับ WebSocket:\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |\n|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Public Marketplace** |\n| GET    | `/api/public/agents` | ดึงรายการ Agent ที่ public

Users must receive a verification email after successful registration\n4. Users must verify their email address before accessing platform features\n5. Verification tokens must expire after 24 hours for security\n6. Users can request a new verification email if the original expires\n7. Registration must fail gracefully with clear error messages for invalid inputs\n\n### Story 2: User Login and Session Management\n\nAs a registered user, I want to log in to my account securely, so that I can access my personalized features and maintain my session across platform interactions.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Users must log in with their email and password\n2. Successful login must generate access and refresh tokens\n3. Access tokens must expire after 15 minutes for security\n4. Refresh tokens must expire after 7 days for convenience\n5. Users must be able to refresh their access token without re-authentication\n6. Users must be able to log out and invalidate their tokens\n7. Failed login attempts must be rate limited to prevent brute force attacks\n\n### Story 3: OAuth Integration with External Providers\n\nAs a user, I want to authenticate using external providers like Google, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating additional credentials.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Users must be able to authenticate using Google OAuth 2.0\n2. Google authentication must create or link to existing user accounts\n3. Users must be able to connect multiple OAuth providers to their account\n4. OAuth authentication must follow standard OAuth 2.0 flow\n5. User profile information must be securely retrieved from providers\n6. OAuth authentication must generate the same JWT tokens as email/password login\n7. Users must be able to disconnect OAuth providers from their account\n\n### Story 4: Password Reset and Recovery\n\nAs a user, I want to reset my forgotten password securely, so that I can regain access to my account without compromising security.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Users must request password reset with their registered email\n2. Password reset tokens must be sent via email\n3. Reset tokens must expire after 1 hour for security\n4. Reset tokens must be single-use and invalidated after use\n5. New passwords must meet the same security requirements as registration\n6. Users must be logged out from all active sessions after password reset\n7. Users must receive confirmation emails when their password is changed\n\n### Story 5: Sora2 OAuth Integration with Verification Codes\n\nAs a user integrating with Sora2 video generation service, I want to authenticate using verification codes, so that I can securely connect to the video generation platform.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. Users must initiate Sora2 OAuth integration through the platform\n2. A unique verification code must be generated and sent via email\n3. Users must verify the code to proceed with OAuth flow\n4.
