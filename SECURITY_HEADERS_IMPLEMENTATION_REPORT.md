### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Production CSP (Strict):**
```
default-src 'self'; 
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{NONCE}'; 
style-src 'self' 'nonce-{NONCE}'; 
img-src 'self' data: https:; 
connect-src 'self' https://api.smart-ai-hub.com; 
font-src 'self'; 
object-src 'none'; 
frame-ancestors 'none'; 
base-uri 'self'; 
form-action 'self'; 
upgrade-insecure-requests;
report-uri /api/v1/security/csp-report;
```

**Staging CSP (Relaxed):**
```
default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; 
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' localhost:* ws://localhost:*; 
connect-src 'self' localhost:* ws://localhost:*; 
report-uri /api/v1/security/csp-report;
```

**Development CSP (Permissive):**
```
default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' *; 
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' *; 
connect-src 'self' *; 
report-uri /api/v1/security/csp-report;
```

### 4. Security Monitoring Dashboard

**Features Implemented:**
- Real-time security headers status
- CSP violation tracking and management
- Security score calculation (A+ to F rating)
- Security recommendations based on configuration
- Test headers functionality
- Violation history and analysis

**Access:** `/admin/security/headers`

### 5. CSP Violation Reporting

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/security/csp-report`

**Features:**
- Automatic violation collection and storage
- In-memory violation management with cleanup
- Severity classification (high, medium, low)
- Violation analytics and trend analysis

### 6. Security Headers Test Scripts

**Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/test-security-headers.sh` - Linux/macOS
- `scripts/test-security-headers.bat` - Windows

**Test Coverage:**
- All 10+ security headers verification
- CSP policy validation
- HSTS enforcement checking
- CSP violation reporting test
- Security status endpoint test
- Browser compatibility testing

## Security Score Calculation

The implementation includes a comprehensive security scoring algorithm:

### Score Components:
- **Headers Present** (60%): Each required header contributes points
- **CSP Strictness** (25%): Stricter CSP policies score higher
- **HSTS Configuration** (10%): Proper HSTS setup adds points
- **Violations** (-5% each): Recent violations reduce score

### Score Ratings:
- **A+**: 95-100 points
- **A**: 90-94 points
- **B**: 80-89 points
- **C**: 70-79 points
- **D**: 60-69 points
- **F**: Below 60 points

3. Verify external security scores
4. Test all user flows for compatibility
5. Update documentation with any required changes
