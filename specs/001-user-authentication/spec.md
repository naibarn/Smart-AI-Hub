# EPIC-001: User Authentication System

## 1. Overview

The User Authentication System is the foundation of the Smart AI Hub platform, providing secure user identity verification, session management, and integration capabilities. This epic encompasses three main authentication approaches: traditional JWT-based authentication, session-based authentication for third-party integrations, and OAuth with verification codes for Custom GPT integration.

The system ensures secure user authentication across multiple access methods while maintaining a consistent security posture and user experience. It supports traditional email/password authentication, OAuth integration with external providers like Google, and specialized authentication flows for third-party integrations.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide comprehensive user authentication capabilities through multiple methods
2. Implement secure session management with both JWT and session-based approaches
3. Enable seamless third-party integrations with proper authentication mechanisms
4. Ensure high security standards across all authentication flows
5. Support OAuth integration with external providers and custom verification code flows
6. Maintain performance and scalability for all authentication operations
7. Provide comprehensive audit trails and monitoring capabilities

## 3. Features

### 3.1. Core Authentication (FEAT-001)

Traditional JWT-based authentication with email/password and OAuth provider support.

### 3.2. Session-Based Authentication (FEAT-002)

   - Mitigation: Implement multiple email providers and fallback mechanisms

3. **OAuth Provider Changes**: External provider API changes could break integration
   - Mitigation: Implement adapter pattern and stay updated with provider changes

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Database Performance**: High volume of authentication requests could slow down database
   - Mitigation: Implement proper indexing, caching, and database optimization

2. **Token Security**: Compromised JWT secrets could allow token forgery
   - Mitigation: Regular key rotation, strong secret management, and token validation

3. **Redis Failure**: Session management could be impacted
   - Mitigation: Implement Redis clustering and fallback mechanisms

### Low Priority Risks

1. **Rate Limiting Evasion**: Attackers might bypass rate limiting mechanisms
