# Promo System & Discounts

## Overview

The Promo System & Discounts feature provides a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, and tracking promotional codes and discount campaigns. This system enables administrators to create various types of promotional offers, manage their lifecycle, and track redemption patterns to optimize marketing efforts.

## User Stories

### As a system administrator, I want to create promotional codes with different attributes so that I can run diverse marketing campaigns.

### As a system administrator, I want to set usage limits and expiration dates on promo codes so that I can control campaign scope and duration.

### As a user, I want to apply promo codes to my account so that I can receive credits or discounts.

### As a system administrator, I want to track promo code redemption patterns so that I can analyze campaign effectiveness.

### As a user, I want to view my promo code redemption history so that I can track my benefits.

### As a system administrator, I want to deactivate promo codes so that I can stop campaigns when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Promo Code Management

- [ ] Administrators can create promo codes with customizable attributes
- [ ] Promo codes support configurable credit amounts
- [ ] Usage limits can be set (unlimited or specific number)
- [ ] Expiration dates can be configured (or none for permanent codes)
- [ ] Promo codes can be activated or deactivated
- [ ] Unique validation prevents duplicate codes
- [ ] Admin interface provides search and filtering capabilities

### Redemption Process

- [ ] Users can redeem promo codes through the application
- [ ] System validates code existence and active status
- [ ] System checks usage limits before redemption
- [ ] System checks expiration dates before redemption
- [ ] System prevents duplicate redemption by the same user
- [ ] Credits are added to user accounts upon successful redemption
- [ ] Redemption transactions are recorded with timestamps

### Tracking and Analytics

- [ ] System tracks total redemption count for each promo code
- [ ] System maintains redemption history by user
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows redemption statistics
- [ ] Reports can be generated for campaign analysis
- [ ] System can identify most effective promo codes

### Security and Validation

- [ ] All inputs are properly sanitized and validated
- [ ] Redemption operations are atomic and consistent
- [ ] Audit trails are maintained for all redemption activities
- [ ] Concurrent redemption attempts are handled correctly

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models

#### PromoCode

```prisma
model PromoCode {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  code        String   @unique
  credits     Int
  maxUses     Int?
  usedCount   Int      @default(0)
  expiresAt   DateTime?
  active      Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  redemptions PromoRedemption[]

  @@index([code])
  @@map("promo_codes")
}
```

#### PromoRedemption

```prisma
model PromoRedemption {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String
  codeId    String
  credits   Int
  redeemedAt DateTime @default(now())

  code PromoCode @relation(fields: [codeId], references: [id])

  @@unique([userId, codeId])
  @@index([userId])
  @@map("promo_redemptions")
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Create Promo Code

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/promo-codes`
- **Description**: Creates a new promotional code
- **Authentication**: Admin required
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "code": "WELCOME2025",
    "credits": 100,
    "maxUses": 1000,
    "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }
  ```
- **Response**: Created promo code object

#### Validate Promo Code

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/promo-codes/{code}/validate`
- **Description**: Validates if a promo code is available for use
- **Authentication**: User required
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "valid": true,
    "credits": 100,
    "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }
  ```

#### Redeem Promo Code

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/promo-codes/{code}/redeem`
- **Description**: Redeems a promo code for the authenticated user
- **Authentication**: User required
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "creditsAdded": 100,
    "redemptionId": "uuid"
  }
  ```

#### Get User Redemption History

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/redemptions`
- **Description**: Retrieves redemption history for the authenticated user
- **Authentication**: User required
- **Response**: Array of redemption objects

#### Get Promo Code Analytics

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/promo-codes/analytics`
- **Description**: Retrieves analytics data for promo codes
- **Authentication**: Admin required
- **Response**: Analytics data including redemption counts, trends, etc.

### Business Rules

#### Promo Code Validation

- Codes must be unique across the system
- Codes are case-insensitive for user input but stored consistently
- Codes can contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens
- Minimum code length: 3 characters
- Maximum code length: 50 characters

#### Redemption Rules

- Each user can only redeem a specific promo code once
- Redemption attempts are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- Expired codes cannot be redeemed
- Inactive codes cannot be redeemed
- Codes that have reached max uses cannot be redeemed

#### Credit Allocation

- Credits are added to the user's account immediately upon successful redemption
- Credit transactions are recorded for audit purposes
- Credit allocation is atomic - either fully succeeds or fails

### Performance Requirements

- Promo code validation response time: < 200ms
- Redemption processing time: < 500ms
- Analytics queries: < 2 seconds
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent redemption attempts
- 99.9% uptime during promotional campaigns

### Security Requirements

- All API endpoints require proper authentication
- Admin endpoints require elevated permissions
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Audit trails track all redemption activities
- Sensitive operations require additional verification

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

#### Indexes

- Unique index on promo code field for fast lookups
- Index on userId for efficient user redemption queries
- Composite index on (userId, codeId) for duplicate prevention
- Index on expiresAt for efficient cleanup of expired codes

#### Constraints

- Unique constraint on promo code
- Unique constraint on (userId, codeId) for redemption table
- Check constraint for positive credit amounts
- Check constraint for non-negative usage counts

### Error Handling

#### Validation Errors

- Invalid code format: Return 400 with descriptive message
- Code not found: Return 404
- Code expired: Return 410 with expiration date
- Code inactive: Return 410 with deactivation info
- Usage limit exceeded: Return 410 with limit info
- Already redeemed: Return 409 with redemption info

#### System Errors

- Database errors: Return 500 with generic error message
- Concurrent modification: Return 409 with retry suggestion
- Rate limit exceeded: Return 429 with retry-after header

### Integration Points

#### User Management System

- Handles credit balance calculations

#### Notification System
