# Authentication Service

## 1. Overview

The Authentication Service handles all user authentication, authorization, and identity management functions for the Smart AI Hub platform. It supports traditional email/password authentication as well as OAuth integration with external providers like Google and Sora2. The service ensures secure user identity verification, token management, and session control while providing a seamless authentication experience across all platform services.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide secure user registration and login functionality with multiple authentication methods
2. Implement robust JWT token management with access and refresh token mechanisms
3. Support OAuth 2.0 integration with external providers (Google, Sora2)
4. Ensure password security through strong hashing policies and secure reset mechanisms
5. Implement email verification to validate user identities and prevent fraud
6. Provide comprehensive session management with token blacklisting capabilities
7. Enable secure password recovery with time-limited, single-use tokens
8. Support rate limiting and abuse prevention for all authentication endpoints

## 3. User Stories

3. Users must receive a verification email after successful registration
4. Users must verify their email address before accessing platform features
5. Verification tokens must expire after 24 hours for security
6. Users can request a new verification email if the original expires
7. Registration must fail gracefully with clear error messages for invalid inputs

### Story 2: User Login and Session Management

As a registered user, I want to log in to my account securely, so that I can access my personalized features and maintain my session across platform interactions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Users must log in with their email and password
2. Successful login must generate access and refresh tokens
3. Access tokens must expire after 15 minutes for security
4. Refresh tokens must expire after 7 days for convenience
5. Users must be able to refresh their access token without re-authentication
6. Users must be able to log out and invalidate their tokens
7. Failed login attempts must be rate limited to prevent brute force attacks

### Story 3: OAuth Integration with External Providers

As a user, I want to authenticate using external providers like Google, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating additional credentials.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

2. Google authentication must create or link to existing user accounts
3. Users must be able to connect multiple OAuth providers to their account
4. OAuth authentication must follow standard OAuth 2.0 flow
5. User profile information must be securely retrieved from providers
6. OAuth authentication must generate the same JWT tokens as email/password login
7. Users must be able to disconnect OAuth providers from their account

### Story 4: Password Reset and Recovery

As a user, I want to reset my forgotten password securely, so that I can regain access to my account without compromising security.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Users must request password reset with their registered email
2. Password reset tokens must be sent via email
3. Reset tokens must expire after 1 hour for security
4. Reset tokens must be single-use and invalidated after use
5. New passwords must meet the same security requirements as registration
6. Users must be logged out from all active sessions after password reset
7. Users must receive confirmation emails when their password is changed

### Story 5: Sora2 OAuth Integration with Verification Codes

As a user integrating with Sora2 video generation service, I want to authenticate using verification codes, so that I can securely connect to the video generation platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Users must initiate Sora2 OAuth integration through the platform
2. A unique verification code must be generated and sent via email
3. Users must verify the code to proceed with OAuth flow
4. OAuth session must be confirmed with additional parameters
5. Successful integration must generate appropriate JWT tokens
