# User Data Model

## 1. Overview

The User data model is the core entity of the Smart AI Hub platform, representing all individuals who interact with the system. It manages user authentication, authorization, profile information, and relationships with other platform entities such as roles, credits, and usage logs. This model serves as the foundation for user management, security, and personalization features throughout the platform.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms
2. Support multiple authentication methods (email/password and OAuth)
3. Maintain comprehensive user profile information
4. Enable role-based access control through user-role relationships
5. Track user activity and usage patterns
6. Support user account lifecycle management
7. Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations
8. Facilitate seamless integration with external services
