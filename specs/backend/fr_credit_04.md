# FR-CREDIT-04: User-Specific Credit Deduction API

## 1. Overview

The User-Specific Credit Deduction API provides a secure and reliable way for third-party services to deduct credits from user balances in the Smart AI Hub platform. This API ensures atomic transactions, proper accounting, and comprehensive audit trails for all credit deductions. The system is designed to handle high-volume requests while maintaining data integrity and preventing race conditions through optimized database operations and transaction management.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide a secure API endpoint for third-party services to deduct user credits
2. Ensure atomic credit deductions to prevent race conditions and maintain data integrity
3. Create comprehensive transaction records with detailed metadata for auditing
4. Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms for failed transactions
5. Support high-volume concurrent deduction requests with optimal performance
6. Maintain accurate user balance updates in real-time across all platform services
7. Provide detailed response information including new balance and transaction IDs

## 3. User Stories

### Story 1: Third-Party Service Credit Deduction

As a third-party service provider, I want to deduct credits from a user's balance when they use my service, so that I can receive payment for the resources consumed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The API must accept a valid user ID via the X-User-ID header
2. The API must validate the user exists before processing the deduction
3. The API must accept service name, cost, and metadata in the request body
4. The API must validate that the cost is a positive number
5. The API must check if the user has sufficient credits before deduction
6. The API must return a 402 Payment Required status if credits are insufficient
7. The API must return the new balance and transaction ID on successful deduction

### Story 2: System Transaction Recording

As a system administrator, I want every credit deduction to be recorded with comprehensive details, so that I can maintain accurate financial records and audit trails.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The system must create a transaction record for every deduction attempt
2. The transaction record must include the user ID, service name, and amount
3. The transaction record must include the original balance and new balance
4. The transaction record must include a timestamp of the deduction
5. The transaction record must include any metadata provided by the service
6. The system must assign a unique transaction ID to every deduction
7. The system must maintain a reference to the service that initiated the deduction

### Story 3: Concurrent Deduction Handling

As a system architect, I want the credit deduction system to handle multiple concurrent requests safely, so that user balances remain accurate even under high load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The system must use database transactions to ensure atomic operations
2. The system must implement row-level locking during balance updates
3. The system must handle race conditions without data corruption
4. The system must process deductions in the order they are received
5. The system must reject duplicate transaction IDs to prevent double charging
6. The system must maintain performance under concurrent load
7. The system must provide timeout handling for long-running transactions
