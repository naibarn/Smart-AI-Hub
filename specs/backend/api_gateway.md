# API Gateway Service

## 1. Overview

The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all API requests to the Smart AI Hub platform. It handles request routing, authentication verification, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns. The gateway provides a unified interface for clients to interact with various microservices, abstracting the underlying service architecture and providing consistent security, monitoring, and traffic management across the entire platform.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide a single entry point for all client requests to the Smart AI Hub platform
2. Implement centralized authentication and authorization for all API endpoints
3. Enforce role-based rate limiting to protect backend services from abuse
4. Route requests efficiently to appropriate backend services based on URL patterns
5. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all API traffic
6. Provide high availability and load balancing for backend services
7. Ensure security through proper CORS handling, request validation, and security headers
8. Support WebSocket connections for real-time communication requirements

## 3. User Stories

### Story 1: API Request Routing

As a client application developer, I want to send all API requests to a single endpoint, so that I don't need to manage multiple service URLs and configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The API Gateway must accept requests at a single base URL
2. The gateway must route requests to appropriate services based on URL patterns
3. The routing must be transparent to the client application
4. The gateway must handle service discovery automatically
5. The gateway must return appropriate responses from backend services
6. The gateway must handle service failures gracefully
7. The gateway must maintain request context across service calls

### Story 2: Authentication and Authorization

As a system administrator, I want all API requests to be authenticated and authorized centrally, so that I can enforce security policies consistently across all services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The gateway must validate JWT tokens for all protected routes
2. The gateway must check token validity against a blacklist
3. The gateway must extract user information from valid tokens
4. The gateway must reject requests with invalid or expired tokens
5. The gateway must pass user context to backend services
6. The gateway must support token refresh mechanisms
7. The gateway must log authentication attempts for security monitoring

### Story 3: Rate Limiting

As a platform operator, I want to implement rate limiting based on user roles, so that I can prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The gateway must enforce different rate limits for different user roles
2. The gateway must use Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. The gateway must return appropriate error responses when limits are exceeded
4. The gateway must allow unlimited requests for admin users
5. The gateway must implement sliding window rate limiting
6. The gateway must provide rate limit headers in responses
7. The gateway must allow rate limit configuration updates without restart

### Story 4: Request Monitoring and Logging

As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging of all API requests, so that I can monitor system performance, troubleshoot issues, and analyze usage patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The gateway must generate unique request IDs for tracking
2. The gateway must log request and response details
3. The gateway must record timing metrics for all requests
4. The gateway must log authentication and authorization results
5. The gateway must provide structured logs for analysis
6. The gateway must support different log levels for different environments
7. The gateway must integrate with external monitoring systems
