# API Gateway Service

## 1. Overview

The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all API requests to the Smart AI Hub platform. It handles request routing, authentication verification, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns. The gateway provides a unified interface for clients to interact with various microservices, abstracting the underlying service architecture and providing consistent security, monitoring, and traffic management across the entire platform.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide a single entry point for all client requests to the Smart AI Hub platform
2. Implement centralized authentication and authorization for all API endpoints
3. Enforce role-based rate limiting to protect backend services from abuse
4. Route requests efficiently to appropriate backend services based on URL patterns
5. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all API traffic
6. Provide high availability and load balancing for backend services
7. Ensure security through proper CORS handling, request validation, and security headers
8. Support WebSocket connections for real-time communication requirements

## 3. User Stories

2. The gateway must use Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. The gateway must return appropriate error responses when limits are exceeded
4. The gateway must allow unlimited requests for admin users
5. The gateway must implement sliding window rate limiting
6. The gateway must provide rate limit headers in responses
7. The gateway must allow rate limit configuration updates without restart

### Story 4: Request Monitoring and Logging

As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging of all API requests, so that I can monitor system performance, troubleshoot issues, and analyze usage patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The gateway must generate unique request IDs for tracking
2. The gateway must log request and response details
3. The gateway must record timing metrics for all requests
4. The gateway must log authentication and authorization results
