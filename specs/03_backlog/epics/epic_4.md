    // Verify JWT from query param or header
    try {
      const token = extractToken(info.req);
      const user = await verifyToken(token);
      info.req.user = user;
      callback(true);
    } catch (error) {
      callback(false, 401, 'Unauthorized');
    }
  },
});
```

**Message Protocol**:

```typescript
// Client → Server
interface MCPRequest {
  id: string; // Unique request ID
  type: 'completion' | 'chat'; // Request type
  provider?: 'openai' | 'claude' | 'auto';
  model: string;
  messages: Message[];
  stream: boolean;
  maxTokens?: number;
  temperature?: number;
}

// Server → Client
interface MCPResponse {

GET /api/sora2/auth/session?code=verification_code
{
  "sessionToken": "session_token_here",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-14T08:57:00Z"
}

// Credit Management for Video Generation
POST /api/credits/check
POST /api/credits/deduct
