# FEAT-002: Access Control & Permissions

## Overview

This specification defines the Access Control & Permissions feature, which implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the application. This feature provides fine-grained permission management, role assignment, and access control mechanisms to ensure that users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their assigned roles. This feature is a core component of the User Authentication & Authorization epic (EPIC-001).

## User Stories

### US-006: Permission Management

As an administrator, I want to define and manage system permissions so that I can control access to different resources and actions.

### US-007: Role Definition

As an administrator, I want to create and manage roles so that I can group related permissions and assign them to users efficiently.

### US-008: Role-Permission Assignment

As an administrator, I want to assign permissions to roles so that I can define what actions each role can perform.

### US-009: Access Control Enforcement

As a system, I want to enforce access control rules so that users can only access resources they are authorized to use.

### US-010: Permission Inheritance

As an administrator, I want to define permission inheritance so that I can create hierarchical permission structures.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-006: Permission Management

- Administrators can create, read, update, and delete permissions
- Each permission must be defined with a resource and action
- Permission names must be unique within the system
- System must validate permission definitions before saving
- All permission changes must be logged for audit purposes

### AC-007: Role Definition

- Administrators can create, read, update, and delete roles
- Each role must have a unique name and description
- Roles can be assigned to multiple users
- System must prevent deletion of roles that are currently assigned
- All role changes must be logged for audit purposes

### AC-008: Role-Permission Assignment

- Administrators can assign multiple permissions to a role
- Administrators can remove permissions from a role
- System must prevent duplicate permission assignments to the same role
- Permission assignments must take effect immediately
- All role-permission changes must be logged for audit purposes

### AC-009: Access Control Enforcement

- System must check user permissions before allowing access to resources
- Access must be denied if user lacks required permissions
- System must provide clear error messages for unauthorized access attempts
- Access checks must be performed at both API and application levels
- All access attempts must be logged for security monitoring

### AC-010: Permission Inheritance

- System must support hierarchical role structures
- Child roles must inherit permissions from parent roles
- Inheritance must be transitive through multiple levels
- Inherited permissions can be explicitly overridden
- System must prevent circular inheritance references

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema

#### Permission Model

```prisma
model Permission {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  name        String   @unique
  resource    String   // users, credits, services
  action      String   // create, read, update, delete

  roles       RolePermission[]

  @@unique([resource, action])
  @@map("permissions")
}
```

#### RolePermission Model

```prisma
model RolePermission {
  roleId       String
  permissionId String

  role       Role @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  permission Permission @relation(fields: [permissionId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@id([roleId, permissionId])
  @@map("role_permissions")
}
```

#### Role Model (Extended)

```prisma
model Role {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  name        String   @unique
  description String
  parentId    String?  @map("parent_id")
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  parent      Role?           @relation("RoleHierarchy", fields: [parentId], references: [id])
  children    Role[]          @relation("RoleHierarchy")
  users       UserRole[]
  permissions RolePermission[]

  @@map("roles")
}
```

### Security Requirements

- Permission checks must be performed for all protected resources
- Access control must be enforced at multiple layers (API, service, database)
- Permission caches must be invalidated immediately when changes occur
- Sensitive operations must require multiple permissions
- All access control failures must be logged and monitored

### Performance Requirements

- Permission checks must complete within 50ms for cached permissions
- Role-permission resolution must complete within 100ms
- System must support 10,000 concurrent permission checks
- Permission data must be cached for high-frequency access
- Database queries must be optimized for complex permission hierarchies

## Data Models

### Permission Entity

The Permission entity represents individual permissions in the system:

- **id**: Unique identifier (UUID)
- **name**: Human-readable permission name
- **resource**: Resource type (users, credits, services, etc.)
- **action**: Action type (create, read, update, delete, etc.)

### RolePermission Entity

The RolePermission entity manages the many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions:

- **roleId**: Reference to the role
- **permissionId**: Reference to the permission

### Role Entity

The Role entity represents user roles with hierarchical structure:

- **id**: Unique identifier (UUID)
- **name**: Unique role name
- **description**: Role description
- **parentId**: Reference to parent role (for inheritance)
- **createdAt**: Role creation timestamp
- **updatedAt**: Last update timestamp

### Relationships

- Permission to RolePermission: One-to-many relationship
- Role to RolePermission: One-to-many relationship
- Role to Role: Self-referencing hierarchy (parent-child)
- RolePermission to Permission: Many-to-one relationship
- RolePermission to Role: Many-to-one relationship

    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Permission Resolution Algorithm

1. Get all roles assigned to the user
2. For each role, get all directly assigned permissions
3. For each role, recursively get inherited permissions from parent roles
4. Merge all permissions, removing duplicates
5. Cache the result for subsequent access checks

### Access Control Middleware

- Implement middleware for API endpoint protection
- Middleware should extract user identity from authentication token
- Check permissions before allowing access to protected resources
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for unauthorized access

### Permission Caching Strategy

- Cache user permissions in Redis with TTL of 15 minutes
- Invalidate cache when user roles or permissions change
- Implement cache warming for frequently accessed users
- Monitor cache hit rates and optimize accordingly

### Error Handling

- Return 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
- Return 401 Unauthorized for missing or invalid authentication
- Log all access denied events for security monitoring
- Provide generic error messages to avoid information leakage

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for permission resolution algorithm
- Integration tests for role-permission assignment workflows
- Security tests for access control bypass attempts
- Performance tests for high-volume permission checks
- Penetration tests for privilege escalation vulnerabilities
