# AI Integration & Model Context Protocol

## Overview

The AI Integration & Model Context Protocol (MCP) feature provides a comprehensive solution for integrating with various Large Language Model (LLM) providers, managing real-time communication via WebSockets, and handling specialized AI workflows including video generation. This system serves as the bridge between the Smart AI Hub platform and external AI services, providing unified access to multiple AI capabilities.

## User Stories

### As a user, I want to interact with different AI models through a unified interface so that I can leverage the best AI capabilities for my needs.

### As a user, I want real-time streaming responses from AI models so that I can see results as they are generated.

### As a user, I want to generate videos from text prompts so that I can create visual content for my projects.

### As a system administrator, I want automatic fallback between AI providers so that I can ensure service availability.

### As a system administrator, I want to track AI usage and costs so that I can manage resources effectively.

### As a developer, I want standardized APIs for AI interactions so that I can build AI-powered features efficiently.

### Data Models

#### MCP Request

```typescript
interface MCPRequest {
  id: string;
  type: 'completion' | 'chat' | 'embedding';
  provider: 'openai' | 'claude' | 'auto';
  model: string;
  messages?: Message[];
  prompt?: string;
  stream: boolean;
  maxTokens?: number;
}
```

#### MCP Response

```typescript
interface MCPResponse {
  id: string;
  type: 'completion';
  data: string;
  usage: {
    promptTokens: number;
    completionTokens: number;
    totalTokens: number;
    credits: number;
  };
  metadata: {
    model: string;
    provider: string;
    latency: number;
  };
}
```

#### Video Request

```typescript
interface Sora2VideoRequest {
  prompt: string;
  duration: number; // seconds
  resolution: '720p' | '1080p' | '4K';
  style?: string;
  aspectRatio?: string;
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

#### Video Response

```typescript
interface Sora2VideoResponse {
  videoId: string;
  status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  url?: string;
  thumbnailUrl?: string;
  duration: number;
  creditsUsed: number;
  createdAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
}
```

### Business Logic

#### Provider Fallback Strategy

```typescript
const providerPriority = ['openai', 'claude'];

async function executeWithFallback(request: MCPRequest): Promise<MCPResponse> {
  let lastError: Error;

  for (const provider of providerPriority) {
    try {
      const result = await providers[provider].execute(request);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error;
      logger.warn(`Provider ${provider} failed, trying next`, { error });

      if (error.code === 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED') {
        await sleep(5000);
      }
    }
  }

  throw new AppError('ALL_PROVIDERS_FAILED', 'All LLM providers failed', { lastError });
}
```

#### Circuit Breaker Implementation

```typescript
import CircuitBreaker from 'opossum';

const options = {
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
  resetTimeout: 30000, // Try again after 30s
};

const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(callOpenAI, options);

breaker.on('open', () => {
  logger.error('Circuit breaker opened for OpenAI');
  // Switch to Claude
});
```

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Protocol

#### Connection Flow

1. Client initiates WebSocket connection with JWT token
2. Server validates token and establishes connection
3. Client sends MCP request with specified parameters
4. Server routes to appropriate provider and begins processing
5. Response streams back in real-time chunks
6. Connection remains open for additional requests

#### Message Formats

```typescript
// Client → Server
{
  "id": "req-123",
  "type": "completion",
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [...],
  "stream": true,
  "maxTokens": 1000
}

// Server → Client (Streaming)
{
  "id": "req-123",
  "type": "chunk",
  "data": "Partial response..."
}

// Server → Client (Complete)
{
  "id": "req-123",
  "type": "done",
  "usage": {
    "promptTokens": 150,
    "completionTokens": 300,
    "totalTokens": 450,
    "credits": 45
  }
}
```

### Video Generation Workflow

#### Standard Text-to-Video

1. User submits text prompt and parameters
2. System validates request and checks credits
3. Request queued for Sora2 processing
4. Video generation begins asynchronously
5. Status updates provided via WebSocket
6. Completed video delivered via CDN

#### Enhanced GPT-Assisted Workflow

1. User provides initial prompt and workflow type
2. Custom GPT analyzes and enhances the prompt
3. Enhanced prompt used for video generation
4. Additional processing steps applied based on workflow
5. Final video delivered with enhanced quality

### Error Handling

#### Provider Errors

- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic backoff and retry
- **Quota Exceeded**: Switch to alternative provider
- **Model Unavailable**: Fallback to similar model
- **API Failure**: Circuit breaker activation

#### System Errors

- **WebSocket Disconnection**: Automatic reconnection
- **Queue Overflow**: Load shedding with notification
- **Credit Insufficient**: Clear error with upgrade options
- **Validation Errors**: Detailed feedback for correction

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Key Metrics

- Request/response latency
- Provider success rates
- Token usage patterns
- Error rates by type
- Connection metrics

#### Alerting

- Provider failure rates > 10%
- Response times > 5 seconds
- Error rates > 5%
- Queue depth > 1000
- Circuit breaker activations
