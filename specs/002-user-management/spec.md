# FEAT-001: User Management & Profiles

## Overview

This specification defines the User Management & Profiles feature, which provides comprehensive user account management capabilities including profile creation, role assignment, and user lifecycle management. This feature is a core component of the User Authentication & Authorization epic (EPIC-001) and serves as the foundation for user-centric operations throughout the system.

## User Stories

### US-001: User Profile Creation
As a new user, I want to create a profile with my personal information so that I can use the system's features and services.

### US-002: Profile Information Management
As a registered user, I want to update my profile information so that I can keep my personal details current.

### US-003: Role Assignment
As an administrator, I want to assign roles to users so that I can control access permissions within the system.

### US-004: User Profile Viewing
As a user, I want to view my profile information so that I can verify my account details.

### US-005: User Account Deactivation
As an administrator, I want to deactivate user accounts so that I can manage user lifecycle and security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: User Profile Creation
- Users must provide valid email address for account creation
- System must validate email uniqueness before account creation
- Users must set a secure password following password policy
- System must send verification email upon successful registration
- User profile must be created with default role assignment

### AC-002: Profile Information Management
- Users can update their profile information through a user-friendly interface
- System must validate all input data before saving changes
- Email changes require re-verification of the new email address
- Profile updates must be reflected immediately in the system
- All profile changes must be logged for audit purposes

### AC-003: Role Assignment
- Administrators can assign multiple roles to a single user
- System must validate role assignments against business rules
- Role assignments must take effect immediately
- Users cannot assign roles to themselves
- All role assignments must be logged for audit purposes

### AC-004: User Profile Viewing
- Users can view their complete profile information
- Profile display must be organized and easy to understand
- Sensitive information must be appropriately masked
- Profile view must include current role assignments
- Profile view must include account creation and last update dates

### AC-005: User Account Deactivation
- Administrators can deactivate user accounts
- Deactivated accounts cannot access system resources
- Deactivation must preserve user data for compliance
- Users must be notified of account deactivation
- Reactivation process must be available for legitimate cases

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema

#### User Model
```prisma
model User {
  id            String   @id @default(uuid())
  email         String   @unique
  passwordHash  String?
  verified      Boolean  @default(false)
  googleId      String?  @unique
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  roles         UserRole[]
  creditAccount CreditAccount?
  usageLogs     UsageLog[]

  @@index([email])
  @@map("users")
}
```

#### UserRole Model
```prisma
model UserRole {
  userId    String
  roleId    String
  assignedAt DateTime @default(now())

  user      User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  role      Role @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@id([userId, roleId])
  @@map("user_roles")
}
```

### Security Requirements

- Passwords must be hashed using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt/argon2)
- All user data must be encrypted at rest
- Personal information must be protected by role-based access control
- All user operations must be logged for audit purposes
- System must comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

### Performance Requirements

- User profile retrieval must complete within 500ms
- Profile update operations must complete within 1 second
- Role assignment operations must complete within 300ms
- System must support 1000 concurrent user profile operations
- Database queries must be optimized for high-volume access

## Data Models

### User Entity
The User entity represents individual users in the system with the following attributes:
- **id**: Unique identifier (UUID)
- **email**: Unique email address for authentication
- **passwordHash**: Hashed password for local authentication
- **verified**: Email verification status
- **googleId**: Google OAuth identifier (optional)
- **createdAt**: Account creation timestamp
- **updatedAt**: Last update timestamp

### UserRole Entity
The UserRole entity manages the many-to-many relationship between users and roles:
- **userId**: Reference to the user
- **roleId**: Reference to the role
- **assignedAt**: Timestamp when the role was assigned

### Relationships
- User to UserRole: One-to-many relationship
- UserRole to Role: Many-to-one relationship
- User to CreditAccount: One-to-one relationship (optional)
- User to UsageLog: One-to-many relationship

## API Contracts

### User Management Endpoints

#### Create User Profile
```
POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}

Response:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "verified": false,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Update User Profile
```
PUT /api/users/{userId}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "phone": "+1234567890"
}

Response:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Get User Profile
```
GET /api/users/{userId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",

  "verified": true,
  "roles": ["user", "premium"],
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z"
}
```

### Role Management Endpoints

#### Assign Role to User
```
POST /api/users/{userId}/roles
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}

{
  "roleId": "role_uuid"
}

Response:
{
  "userId": "user_uuid",
  "roleId": "role_uuid",
  "assignedAt": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

```
DELETE /api/users/{userId}/roles/{roleId}
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}

{
  "message": "Role removed successfully"
}
```

#### Get User Roles
```
GET /api/users/{userId}/roles
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "id": "role_uuid",
      "name": "user",
      "description": "Standard user role",
      "assignedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### User Profile Management
- Profile updates must trigger re-verification for email changes
- System must maintain a complete audit trail of all profile changes
- Profile data must be validated according to business rules
- Profile images must be stored with appropriate security controls

### Role Assignment Logic
- Role assignments must follow hierarchical business rules
- System must prevent circular role dependencies
- Role assignments must be immediately effective
- Role removal must not leave users without basic access

### Error Handling
- All operations must return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Error messages must be user-friendly but not reveal sensitive information
- System must log all errors for debugging and monitoring
- Client applications must handle errors gracefully

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests must cover all user management operations
- Integration tests must verify role assignment workflows
- Security tests must validate access control mechanisms
- Performance tests must verify response time requirements
