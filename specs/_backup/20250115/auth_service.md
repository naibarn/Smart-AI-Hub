# Authentication Service

## 1. Overview

The Authentication Service handles all user authentication, authorization, and identity management functions for the Smart AI Hub platform. It supports traditional email/password authentication as well as OAuth integration with external providers like Google and Sora2. The service ensures secure user identity verification, token management, and session control while providing a seamless authentication experience across all platform services.

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide secure user registration and login functionality with multiple authentication methods
2. Implement robust JWT token management with access and refresh token mechanisms
3. Support OAuth 2.0 integration with external providers (Google, Sora2)
4. Ensure password security through strong hashing policies and secure reset mechanisms
5. Implement email verification to validate user identities and prevent fraud
6. Provide comprehensive session management with token blacklisting capabilities
7. Enable secure password recovery with time-limited, single-use tokens
8. Support rate limiting and abuse prevention for all authentication endpoints
