# EPIC-002: Financial System & Credits

## Overview

This specification defines the Financial System & Credits epic, which provides comprehensive financial management capabilities including credit account management, payment processing, and financial transaction handling. This epic serves as the foundation for all financial operations within the system, enabling users to maintain credit balances, process payments, and track financial activities.

## User Stories

### US-011: Credit Account Creation
As a new user, I want to have a credit account automatically created so that I can start accumulating and using credits for services.

### US-012: Credit Balance Management
As a user, I want to view my credit balance and transaction history so that I can track my financial activities within the system.

### US-013: Credit Purchase
As a user, I want to purchase credits through secure payment methods so that I can access premium services and features.

### US-014: Credit Usage
As a user, I want to use my credits to pay for services so that I can access system features without manual payment processing.

### US-015: Credit Check API
As a third-party service, I want to check if a user has sufficient credits for a service so that I can validate transactions before processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-011: Credit Account Creation

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema

#### CreditAccount Model
```prisma
model CreditAccount {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String   @unique
  balance   Int      @default(0)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  user         User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  transactions CreditTransaction[]

  @@index([userId])
  @@map("credit_accounts")
}
```

#### CreditTransaction Model
```prisma
model CreditTransaction {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  accountId   String
  amount      Int
  type        String   // purchase, usage, refund, bonus
  description String?
  metadata    Json?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  account CreditAccount @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([accountId])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@map("credit_transactions")
}
```

### Security Requirements

- All financial data must be encrypted at rest
- Payment processing must comply with PCI DSS standards
- Credit transactions must be atomic and consistent
- System must prevent race conditions in credit operations
- All financial operations must be logged for audit purposes

### Performance Requirements

- Credit balance checks must complete within 50ms
- Credit transactions must complete within 200ms
- Credit check API must respond within 200ms
- System must handle 1000 concurrent financial operations
- Database queries must be optimized for high-volume transactions

## Data Models

### CreditAccount Entity
The CreditAccount entity represents user credit accounts:
- **id**: Unique identifier (UUID)
- **userId**: Reference to the user account
- **balance**: Current credit balance (in credits)
- **createdAt**: Account creation timestamp
- **updatedAt**: Last update timestamp

### CreditTransaction Entity
The CreditTransaction entity records all credit movements:
- **id**: Unique identifier (UUID)
- **accountId**: Reference to the credit account
- **amount**: Transaction amount (positive for credits, negative for debits)
- **type**: Transaction type (purchase, usage, refund, bonus)
- **description**: Optional transaction description
- **metadata**: Additional transaction data in JSON format
- **createdAt**: Transaction timestamp

### Relationships
- CreditAccount to User: One-to-one relationship
- CreditAccount to CreditTransaction: One-to-many relationship

## Implementation Notes

### Credit Transaction Processing
- All credit transactions must be processed atomically
- System must use database transactions to ensure consistency
- Credit operations must prevent negative balances
- Concurrent credit operations must be properly synchronized

### Payment Integration
- Payment processing must be handled by secure third-party providers
- System must support multiple payment methods
- Payment webhooks must be properly authenticated
- Failed payments must not affect credit balances

### Credit Check API Implementation
- API must use efficient database queries for balance checks
- Concurrent requests must be handled correctly
- API must implement proper rate limiting
- Response times must meet the 200ms requirement

### Error Handling
- All financial operations must have comprehensive error handling
- Error messages must be user-friendly but secure
- Failed operations must not leave system in inconsistent state
- All errors must be logged for debugging and monitoring

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests must cover all financial operations
- Integration tests must verify payment processing workflows
- Performance tests must validate response time requirements
- Security tests must identify financial vulnerabilities
- Load tests must verify system behavior under high transaction volumes
