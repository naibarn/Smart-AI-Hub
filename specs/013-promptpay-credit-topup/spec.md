### US-013-04: AI Slip Verification - Amount Validation

**As a** system  
**I want to** verify transfer amount matches or exceeds expected amount  
**So that** underpayments are rejected and overpayments are handled correctly

**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 story points  
**Dependencies:** US-013-03

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **US-013-AC11:** Extract transfer amount from slip using AI OCR
  - **Parse numeric amount:**
    - English format: 1,234.56 (comma thousand separator, period decimal)
    - Thai format: ‡πë,‡πí‡πì‡πî.‡πï‡πñ (Thai numerals with same separators)
    - Handle no separators: 1234.56
  - **Extract currency:**
    - Must be: THB, ‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏ó, or ‡∏ø
    - Reject if: USD, EUR, or other currency
  - **Handle Thai text amounts:**
    - Example: "‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∂‡πà‡∏á‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏™‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏´‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå"
    - Convert to: 1234.56
  - **Multiple amounts on slip:**
    - Identify: "‡∏à‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏á‡∏¥‡∏ô" (Amount) vs "‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏°" (Fee)
    - Extract: transfer amount only (not fee or total balance)

- **US-013-AC12:** Validate extracted amount is sufficient
  - **Get expected amount:**
    - From: transaction.price_thb (from database)
    - Example: expected = 199.00 THB
  - **Validation rule:**
    - Formula: extracted_amount >= expected_amount
    - **PASS if:** extracted >= expected (exact or overpaid)
    - **FAIL if:** extracted < expected (underpaid)
  - **Examples:**
    - Expected 199.00, Extracted 199.00 ‚Üí PASS (exact)
    - Expected 199.00, Extracted 200.00 ‚Üí PASS (overpaid)
    - Expected 199.00, Extracted 198.00 ‚Üí FAIL (underpaid)
  - **Logging:**
    - Always log: expected_amount, extracted_amount, difference
    - Log pass/fail decision with reason

- **US-013-AC13:** Handle overpayment with bonus credits
  - **Small overpayment (<10 THB):**
    - Difference: extracted - expected < 10
    - Action: Approve, ignore difference (accounting rounding)
    - Example: Paid 200 THB, expected 199 ‚Üí approve, no bonus
  - **Significant overpayment (‚â•10 THB):**
    - Difference: extracted - expected >= 10
    - Action: Approve, add bonus credits
    - **Bonus calculation:**
      - Get: credits_per_thb = package.credits / package.price_thb
      - Calculate: bonus = floor(overpayment_thb \* credits_per_thb)
      - Example: Overpaid 50 THB, rate 0.5 credits/THB ‚Üí bonus 25 credits
    - **Logging:**
      - Store: overpayment_amount, bonus_credits
      - Flag: has_overpayment = true
      - Note: for accounting reconciliation
  - **Maximum overpayment:**
    - If overpayment > 1000 THB: flag for manual review (suspicious)

- **US-013-AC14:** Handle amount extraction failures gracefully
  - **Low confidence scenarios:**
    - Blurry numbers: confidence < 85%
    - Multiple amounts unclear which is transfer amount
    - OCR confusion: "1" vs "l", "0" vs "O"
  - **Action for low confidence:**
    - Set flag: amount_confidence < 85%
    - Flag for manual review
    - Error message: "Cannot clearly verify amount from slip"
    - DO NOT auto-reject: let human verify
  - **Logging:**
    - Store: all extracted numbers with confidence scores
    - Store: AI reasoning for which number is transfer amount

**Technical Notes:**

- **Number parsing library:** Use numeral.js for robust parsing
- **Thai numeral conversion:**
  - Map: ‡πê‚Üí0, ‡πë‚Üí1, ‡πí‚Üí2, ‡πì‚Üí3, ‡πî‚Üí4, ‡πï‚Üí5, ‡πñ‚Üí6, ‡πó‚Üí7, ‡πò‚Üí8, ‡πô‚Üí9
- **Float precision:** Use Decimal.js to avoid floating point errors
- **Rounding:** Always round bonus credits down (floor function)

  - **Decode QR code data:**
    - Parse: EMVCo PromptPay format
    - Extract: PromptPay ID, amount, currency from QR payload
  - **Verify QR matches slip details:**
    - Compare: QR PromptPay ID == slip printed PromptPay ID
    - Compare: QR amount == slip printed amount
    - Compare: QR currency == THB
  - **QR validation results:**
    - All match: qr_code_valid = true, high confidence
    - Mismatch: qr_code_valid = false, flag as suspicious
    - Cannot decode: qr_code_valid = null, flag for review
  - **QR readability:**
    - If QR too small/blurry to decode: flag for review
    - If no QR present: lower authenticity score (some banks don't include QR)

- **US-013-AC17:** Detect image manipulation and editing
  - **Compression artifact analysis:**
    - Check: JPEG compression levels across image
    - Edited images: have inconsistent compression (re-saved multiple times)
    - Detect: if some areas have different compression than others
  - **Clone stamp detection:**
    - Look for: repeated patterns (user copied/pasted numbers)
    - Example: same "9" digit used multiple times in different positions
  - **Content-aware fill detection:**
    - Look for: blurred or smudged areas indicating removal/addition
    - Check: unnatural pixel patterns
  - **EXIF metadata analysis:**
    - Extract: camera model, edit software, creation date
    - Red flags:
      - Edited with: Photoshop, GIMP (editing software)
      - No EXIF data: suspicious (stripped to hide edits)
      - Created date != screenshot time
  - **Screenshot vs photo:**
    - Screenshot: clean edges, consistent resolution, no camera artifacts
    - Photo of screen: moir√© patterns, glare, uneven brightness
    - Prefer: screenshots (more authentic)
    - Suspicious: photo of screen (potential re-screenshot of fake)

- **US-013-AC18:** Validate transaction timestamp is recent and valid
  - **Extract date/time from slip:**
    - Format: "18/01/2568 14:23:45" (Thai Buddhist year)
    - Parse: day, month, year, hour, minute, second
  - **Convert Buddhist year to Gregorian:**
    - Formula: gregorian_year = buddhist_year - 543
    - Example: 2568 - 543 = 2025
  - **Timezone handling:**
    - Assume: Bangkok timezone (UTC+7)
    - Convert to UTC for storage
  - **Validation rules:**
    - Transaction must be: within last 24 hours
    - Transaction must NOT be: in the future
    - **REJECT if:** timestamp > 24 hours old ("Payment slip expired")
    - **REJECT if:** timestamp in future ("Invalid timestamp")
  - **Edge cases:**
    - Transaction exactly at midnight: allow
    - Transaction during daylight saving: N/A (Thailand doesn't have DST)

- **US-013-AC19:** AI holistic authenticity analysis
  - **LLM comprehensive review:**
    - Prompt: "Analyze this payment slip for authenticity. Look for signs it's fake or edited."
    - LLM checks: overall consistency, logical coherence, realistic transaction flow
  - **Common fake slip patterns:**
    - Misaligned text
    - Fonts don't match bank's standard
    - Numbers look "too perfect" (computer-generated)
    - Shadows/highlights inconsistent
    - Low-res logo pasted on high-res background
  - **Authenticity scoring:**
    - Output: authenticity_score (0-100)
    - High confidence: >= 95 (clearly authentic)
    - Medium confidence: 80-94 (probably authentic)
    - Low confidence: < 80 (suspicious)
  - **Decision thresholds:**
    - **Auto-approve:** authenticity >= 95 AND all other checks pass
    - **Manual review:** authenticity 80-94 OR any uncertainty
    - **Auto-reject:** authenticity < 80 AND clear fake indicators
  - **AI reasoning:**
    - Store: detailed explanation from LLM
    - Example: "Logo appears genuine, fonts consistent, QR validates, timestamp recent. Appears authentic."
    - Example: "Text alignment inconsistent, amount appears edited (compression mismatch), QR doesn't match printed amount. Likely fake."

**Technical Notes:**

- **Image analysis libraries:**
  - QR decode: jsQR
  - EXIF parsing: exif-parser (npm)

### US-013-06: Duplicate Slip Detection

**As a** system  
**I want to** prevent same payment slip from being used multiple times  
**So that** users cannot fraudulently reuse slips to get credits repeatedly

**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 story points  
**Dependencies:** US-013-02

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **US-013-AC20:** Generate unique fingerprint for each uploaded slip
  - **Perceptual hash (pHash):**
    - Algorithm: DCT-based perceptual hashing
    - Library: imghash (npm)
    - Output: 64-bit hash as hexadecimal string
    - Example: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8"
  - **Why perceptual hash:**
    - Resilient to: minor crops, resizes, compression
    - Similar images: produce similar hashes
    - Different images: produce different hashes
  - **Extract transaction reference:**
    - Look for: "‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏≠‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏á" (Reference number)
    - Pattern: alphanumeric 8-20 chars
    - Example: "REF123456789"
    - Store if found: reference_number field
  - **Create composite key:**
    - Combine: {extracted*timestamp}*{extracted*amount}*{recipient_id}
    - Example: "20250118142345_199.00_0812345678"
    - Hash: SHA256 to create fixed-length key
  - **Store all fingerprints:**
    - Table: slip_image_hashes
    - Fields: transaction_id, perceptual_hash, reference_number, composite_key, created_at

- **US-013-AC21:** Check for duplicates before approving transaction
  - **Query 1: Perceptual hash match**
    - Find: hashes with similarity > 95%
    - Calculate: Hamming distance between hashes
    - Formula: similarity = 1 - (hamming_distance / 64)
    - Match if: similarity >= 0.95
  - **Query 2: Transaction reference match**
    - Find: slips with same reference_number
    - Match if: exact string match (case-insensitive)
  - **Query 3: Composite key match**
    - Find: slips with same {timestamp + amount + recipient}
    - Match if: exact match
  - **Decision logic:**
    - If ANY match found: duplicate detected
    - Get: original transaction details
    - Action: reject new transaction
  - **Performance:**
    - Index: perceptual_hash, reference_number, composite_key
    - Query time: < 100ms

- **US-013-AC22:** Allow legitimate similar transactions
  - **Same user, different legitimate transactions:**
    - Same user: makes 2 separate payments (different times)
    - Same amount: coincidentally pays same amount
    - Different timestamps: 1+ hours apart
    - Action: ALLOW (legitimate separate transactions)
  - **Perceptual hash tolerance:**
    - Threshold: 95% similarity
    - Allows: slight crops (user crops screenshot)
    - Allows: minor resizes (user resizes before upload)
    - Allows: JPEG re-compression
    - Prevents: exact duplicates
  - **Different users, same slip:**
    - User A: uploads slip
    - User B: uploads SAME slip (fraud attempt)
    - Action: REJECT User B's transaction
    - Reason: "This slip has already been used by another account"
    - Alert: security team (potential fraud ring)

- **US-013-AC23:** Provide clear duplicate rejection message
  - **Error message:**
    - Title: "Duplicate Payment Slip Detected"
    - Body: "This payment slip has already been used for a credit purchase."
    - Details: "Previously used on: January 15, 2025 at 2:30 PM"
    - Action: "Please contact support if you believe this is an error."
    - Support: Provide transaction ID for both transactions
  - **Logging for investigation:**
    - Log: current transaction_id, duplicate transaction_id
    - Log: user_id for both (detect if same user or different)
    - Log: similarity score, match type (hash/reference/composite)
    - Alert: if different users (fraud attempt)

**Technical Notes:**

- **Hashing algorithm:**
  - Library: `imghash` or `sharp` with perceptual hash plugin
  - Hash size: 64 bits (balance accuracy vs speed)
- **Hamming distance:**
  - XOR two hashes, count 1-bits
  - Fast operation: < 1ms
- **Database schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE slip_image_hashes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES credit_transactions(id),
  perceptual_hash VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
  reference_number VARCHAR(50),
  composite_key VARCHAR(64),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '90 days'
);

CREATE INDEX idx_perceptual_hash ON slip_image_hashes(perceptual_hash);
CREATE INDEX idx_reference_number ON slip_image_hashes(reference_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_composite_key ON slip_image_hashes(composite_key);
```

- **Retention policy:**
  - Keep hashes: 90 days
  - Auto-delete: daily cron job at 2 AM
  - Reason: balance fraud prevention vs storage costs

### US-013-07: Automatic Credit Allocation

**As a** user whose payment slip passed all verifications  
**I want to** receive credits immediately  
**So that** I can start using the service without delay

**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 story points  
**Dependencies:** US-013-03, US-013-04, US-013-05, US-013-06

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **US-013-AC24:** Allocate credits automatically upon successful verification
  - **Calculate total credits:**
    - Base: package.credits_amount
    - Bonus: bonus_credits (from overpayment, if any)
    - Total: base_credits + bonus_credits
    - Example: 100 (base) + 25 (bonus) = 125 credits
  - **Update user balance atomically:**
    - Query: `UPDATE users SET credit_balance = credit_balance + {total_credits} WHERE id = {user_id}`
    - Use: database transaction (BEGIN...COMMIT)
    - Lock: SELECT FOR UPDATE to prevent race conditions
  - **Mark transaction complete:**
    - Update: transaction.status = "completed"
    - Set: transaction.completed_at = NOW()
    - Set: transaction.credits_allocated = total_credits
  - **All-or-nothing operation:**
    - If ANY step fails: ROLLBACK entire transaction
    - Ensure: credits never allocated without marking transaction complete
    - Ensure: transaction never marked complete without allocating credits

- **US-013-AC25:** Create immutable transaction record
  - **Store comprehensive details:**

```sql
-- Example record
{
  transaction_id: "TXN-20250118-A7K9M",
  user_id: "user-uuid",
  package_id: "pkg_100_credits",
  credits_purchased: 100,
  bonus_credits: 25,
  total_credits: 125,
  price_thb: 199.00,
  amount_paid_thb: 249.00,
  overpayment_thb: 50.00,
  slip_image_path: "storage/slips/2025/01/TXN-20250118-A7K9M.jpg",
  verification_results: {
    recipient_valid: true,
    recipient_confidence: 98,
    amount_valid: true,
    amount_confidence: 95,
    authenticity_score: 97,
    duplicate_check_passed: true,
    overall_confidence: 97
  },
  status: "completed",
  created_at: "2025-01-18T14:00:00Z",
  completed_at: "2025-01-18T14:05:30Z",
  ip_address: "103.xxx.xxx.xxx",
  user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```

- **Immutability rules:**
  - Once status = "completed": NO updates allowed
  - Use: database constraint or application logic
  - Audit trail: never delete, only mark as refunded (if needed in future)

- **US-013-AC26:** Send confirmation notifications to user
  - **Email notification:**
    - Subject: "‚úì Credits Successfully Added to Your Account"
    - Body:
      - "Hi {user_name},"
      - "Your payment of {amount_thb} THB has been verified."
      - "Credits added: {total_credits} credits"
      - "New balance: {new_balance} credits"
      - "Transaction ID: {transaction_id}"
      - "Date: {completed_at}"
      - "[View Invoice]" button
    - Attach: PDF invoice (see below)
  - **In-app notification:**
    - Show: toast notification "‚úì Credits added! New balance: {new_balance}"
    - Badge: red dot on credits icon (until user clicks)
    - Notification center: "Credits added successfully" entry
  - **SMS notification (optional):**
    - Message: "SmartAIHub: 125 credits added. New balance: 500 credits. Ref: TXN-ABC"
    - Only if: user enabled SMS notifications in settings
  - **Invoice PDF generation:**
    - Library: PDFKit (Node.js)
    - Include:
      - Company logo and address
      - Invoice number: INV-{transaction_id}
      - Date: {completed_at}
      - Bill to: {user_name}, {user_email}
      - Item: "{package_name} - {credits} credits"
      - Amount: {price_thb} THB
      - Bonus: +{bonus_credits} credits (if any)
      - Total: {total_credits} credits
      - Payment method: PromptPay
      - Tax info (if applicable)
    - Store: storage/invoices/{year}/{month}/INV-{transaction_id}.pdf
    - Serve: via authenticated download link

- **US-013-AC27:** Prevent race conditions and duplicate allocations
  - **Scenario: User refreshes page multiple times**
    - Problem: Multiple allocation requests sent
    - Solution: Idempotency key (transaction_id)
    - Check: IF transaction.status == "completed" THEN skip allocation
  - **Scenario: Webhook fires multiple times**
    - Problem: Multiple completion events
    - Solution: Check status before processing
  - **Scenario: Two processes allocate simultaneously**
    - Problem: Credits allocated twice
    - Solution: Database row locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE)
  - **Implementation:**

```javascript
async function allocateCredits(transactionId) {
  const db = await startTransaction();
  try {
    // Lock transaction row
    const txn = await db.query('SELECT * FROM credit_transactions WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE', [
      transactionId,
    ]);

    // Idempotency check
    if (txn.status === 'completed') {
      await db.rollback();
      return { success: true, message: 'Already allocated' };
    }

    // Allocate credits
    await db.query('UPDATE users SET credit_balance = credit_balance + $1 WHERE id = $2', [
      txn.total_credits,
      txn.user_id,
    ]);

    // Mark complete
    await db.query(
      'UPDATE credit_transactions SET status = $1, completed_at = NOW() WHERE id = $2',
      ['completed', transactionId]
    );

    await db.commit();
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    await db.rollback();
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**Technical Notes:**

- **Database isolation level:** SERIALIZABLE or REPEATABLE READ
- **Transaction timeout:** 5 seconds max
- **Retry logic:** No retries (idempotent, safe to call again)
- **Email service:** Nodemailer with SMTP
- **Queue:** Use job queue (Bull) for async email sending (don't block credit allocation)

    - **If Request Info:**
      - Send: email with request
      - Keep: in review queue (lower priority)
      - Allow: user to re-upload

- **US-013-AC31:** System learns from manual reviews to improve AI
  - **Track metrics:**
    - Manual approval rate: approvals / (approvals + rejections)
    - False positive rate: auto-rejected but manually approved

    - Suggestions: "Lower Kbank logo confidence threshold to 85%"
  - **Threshold adjustments:**
    - If: false positive rate > 5% for specific check
    - Then: consider lowering confidence threshold
    - Example: If many authentic SCB slips score 85% (just below 90% threshold)
    - Action: Lower SCB authenticity threshold to 80%
  - **Future ML training:**
    - Collect: manually reviewed slips with labels (authentic/fake)
    - Use: to fine-tune AI model (Phase 2)
    - Goal: Reduce manual review rate from 10% to 5%

**Technical Notes:**

- **Admin panel:**

  - Auth: require admin role (RBAC)
  - Framework: React Admin or custom dashboard
- **Real-time updates:**
  - WebSocket: notify admins of new flags instantly
  - Polling: fallback if WebSocket unavailable (every 30 seconds)
- **SLA tracking:**
  - Store: flagged_at, reviewed_at
  - Calculate: review_duration = reviewed_at - flagged_at
  - Alert: if any item > 2 hours unreviewed during business hours
- **Batch actions:**
  - Allow: admin to select multiple similar items and approve/reject all
  - Use case: Same user uploads 3 slips for 3 transactions, all same issue

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE manual_review_queue (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  transaction_id UUID REFERENCES credit_transactions(id),
  flagged_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  flag_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'normal', -- high, normal, low
  reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  decision VARCHAR(20), -- approve, reject, request_info
  decision_reason TEXT,
  decision_notes TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_review_queue_status ON manual_review_queue(reviewed_at) WHERE reviewed_at IS NULL;
```

## Business Rules

### BR-001: Payment Amount Constraints

- **Minimum payment:** 100 THB (prevent micro-transactions, reduce processing costs)
- **Maximum payment:** 50,000 THB per transaction (fraud prevention, AML compliance)
- **Overpayment handling:**
  - If overpayment < 10 THB: Ignore (accounting rounding, no bonus)
  - If overpayment >= 10 THB: Convert to bonus credits at package rate
  - Example: Package 100 credits for 199 THB (1.996 THB/credit). Overpaid 50 THB = 25 bonus credits.
- **Underpayment:** Any amount below expected is rejected (no partial payments)

### BR-002: Transaction Lifecycle and Expiration

- **Payment window:** 30 minutes from transaction initiation
  - User must: initiate payment within 30 minutes
  - After 30 min: QR code expires, must create new transaction
- **Slip upload window:** 24 hours from payment
  - User can: upload slip anytime within 24 hours after payment
  - Allows: users who pay but forget to upload immediately
- **Auto-expiration:** 24 hours after creation if no slip uploaded
  - Status: changes to "expired"
  - Action: no credits allocated
  - User: must create new transaction
- **Expired transaction cleanup:** 7 days after expiration
  - Action: soft delete (mark deleted_at, keep for audit)
  - Reason: free up database, maintain performance

### BR-003: AI Verification Confidence Thresholds

- **Overall confidence scoring:**
  - Formula: (recipient_conf + amount_conf + authenticity_score) / 3
  - Weighted: authenticity_score √ó 1.5 (most important)
  - Example: (95 + 90 + 85√ó1.5) / 3.5 = 91.4%
- **Decision thresholds:**
  - **Auto-approve:** overall >= 95% AND all individual >= 90%
  - **Manual review:** overall 80-94% OR any individual 80-89%
  - **Auto-reject:** overall < 80% OR any critical individual < 75%
- **Component thresholds:**
  - Recipient confidence: >= 90% (critical: wrong recipient = wrong company)
  - Amount confidence: >= 85% (important: but can verify manually easily)
  - Authenticity score: >= 95% (critical: fake slip = fraud)

### BR-004: Duplicate Slip Prevention

- **Image hash similarity threshold:** 95%
  - Calculation: 1 - (hamming_distance / 64)
  - Allows: minor crops, resizes, compression (5% tolerance)
  - Prevents: exact duplicates (same image)
- **Hash retention period:** 90 days
  - Reason: balance fraud prevention vs storage costs
  - Assumption: unlikely user keeps slip > 90 days
- **Suspicious pattern flagging:**
  - Same user + same amount + within 1 hour: flag for review
  - Different users + same slip: reject second user, alert security team
  - Same user + 3+ rejected slips in 24 hours: block user, require manual unblock

### BR-005: Slip Storage and Auto-Cleanup (Local Phase 1)

- **Storage location:** `storage/slips/{year}/{month}/`
  - Example: `storage/slips/2025/01/TXN-20250118-A7K9M_1705564800.jpg`
  - Organized by: year and month for easier management
- **File naming convention:** `{transaction_id}_{unix_timestamp}.{ext}`
  - transaction_id: ensures uniqueness
  - unix_timestamp: prevents filename collision if user re-uploads
  - ext: preserves original format (jpg, png, pdf)
- **File permissions:** 600 (owner read/write only)
  - Security: prevents unauthorized access via web server
  - Serve: only through authenticated API endpoint
- **Auto-delete policy:** Slips older than 30 days
  - Reason: compliance, privacy, storage management
  - Exception: Keep if transaction has dispute_open flag
  - Exception: Keep if transaction is under investigation
- **Cleanup schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM server time (Bangkok UTC+7)
  - Cron: `0 2 * * * node scripts/cleanup-old-slips.js`
  - Process:
    1. Find: slips with created_at < NOW() - 30 days
    2. Check: transaction.dispute_open == false
    3. Delete: file from disk
    4. Log: deleted file path and count
    5. Update: transaction.slip_deleted_at = NOW()
- **Cleanup logging:**
  - Log to: storage/logs/slip-cleanup.log
  - Format: `[2025-01-18 02:00:05] Deleted 127 slips older than 30 days`
  - Alert: if deletion fails or count unusually high (>1000)
- **Thumbnail retention:** Delete thumbnails with original
  - Thumbnails: stored in `storage/slips/thumbnails/{transaction_id}.jpg`
  - Auto-delete: when original is deleted

### BR-006: Manual Review Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- **Business hours:** 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM Bangkok time (UTC+7)
- **SLA during business hours:** 2 hours maximum
  - Priority: high transactions reviewed within 1 hour
  - Priority: normal transactions within 2 hours
  - Priority: low transactions within 4 hours
- **SLA after business hours:** Next business day
  - Flagged after 6 PM: reviewed by 11 AM next day
  - Flagged on weekend: reviewed by 11 AM Monday
- **Public holidays:** Next business day (follow Thai calendar)
- **Notification to users:**
  - In-app: "Your payment is being reviewed. Expected within 2 hours."
  - Email: "We're reviewing your payment slip. You'll hear from us soon!"
- **Escalation:** If > 2 hours unreviewed, alert admin manager

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low AI Verification Accuracy

- **Impact:** High false rejections ‚Üí user frustration, lost sales
- **Probability:** Medium (30-40%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Extensive testing with 100+ real slip samples before launch
  - Manual review queue as safety net
  - Continuous monitoring and threshold tuning
  - Collect feedback and improve prompts
  - Consider fine-tuning model with labeled data (Phase 2)

### Risk 2: AI API Downtime or High Latency

- **Impact:** Cannot verify slips, users stuck waiting
- **Probability:** Low (5-10% uptime issues)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use multiple providers (OpenAI + Anthropic)
  - Auto-fallback if primary API down
  - Queue requests, retry with exponential backoff
  - Manual review queue as ultimate fallback
  - Status page showing AI API health

### Risk 3: Sophisticated Fraud Attacks

- **Impact:** Financial loss from fake slips
- **Probability:** Medium (20-30% of users may attempt)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Multiple verification layers (recipient + amount + authenticity + duplicate)
  - QR code validation (hardest to fake)
  - Manual review for suspicious patterns
  - Rate limiting prevents mass attempts
  - Fraud monitoring dashboard
  - Block repeat offenders

### Risk 4: Privacy and Compliance Concerns

- **Impact:** Legal issues, user trust loss
- **Probability:** Low (10%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Encrypt slips at rest (Phase 2)
  - Auto-delete after 30 days (PDPA compliance)
  - Hash PII in logs
  - Clear privacy policy and consent
  - Regular security audits

### Risk 5: Storage Costs Grow Too High

- **Impact:** High costs for storing millions of slips
- **Probability:** Medium (if we scale fast)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Auto-delete policy (30 days)
  - Compress images before storage
  - Migrate to cloud storage (S3) for cheaper archival (Phase 2)
  - Consider aggressive compression for old slips

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope - Phase 2+)

### Phase 2: Real-time Bank API Integration

- Integrate with: PromptPay Gateway API (if available)
- No slip upload: Verify payments automatically via API
- Instant crediting: Credits added within seconds of payment
- Benefit: Better UX, no manual upload needed

### Phase 3: Multiple Payment Methods

- Credit card: Stripe, Omise
- Mobile banking: SCB Easy, Kbank Next
- International: PayPal, Wise

### Phase 4: Automated Refund Processing

- Self-service refunds: for rejected transactions
- Partial refunds: if overpaid significantly
- Refund timeline: 3-5 business days

### Phase 5: Machine Learning Model Training

- Collect: manually reviewed slips (labeled authentic/fake)
- Train: custom slip verification model
- Goal: 99% accuracy, reduce to < 5% manual review
- Cost: Lower than API calls long-term

### Phase 6: Blockchain Receipt Verification

- Issue: NFT receipt for each transaction
- Benefit: Immutable proof of payment
- Use case: Tax compliance, disputes
