# US-11: Credit Management APIs for External Services

## User Story
As a third-party AI service provider
I want to check and deduct user credits via API
So that I can charge for service usage through Smart AI Hub

## Acceptance Criteria
- Credit check API with user ID and service cost
- Credit deduction API with transaction metadata
- Atomic transactions to prevent race conditions
- Insufficient credit handling
- Transaction record creation for audit trail
