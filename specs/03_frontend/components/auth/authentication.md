# Authentication Components

## 1. ภาพรวม (Overview)

Authentication components provide secure user authentication flows for the Smart AI Hub platform. These components handle user registration, login, password reset, and OAuth integration with Google.

## 2. วัตถุประสงค์ (Objectives)

- ให้ผู้ใช้สามารถลงทะเบียนและล็อกอินเข้าสู่ระบบได้อย่างปลอดภัย
- รองรับการล็อกอินหลายช่องทาง (Email/Password และ Google OAuth)
- จัดการการรีเซ็ตรหัสผ่านอย่างปลอดภัย
- ให้ประสบการณ์ผู้ใช้ที่สม่ำเสมอและเป็นมิตร
