## 2. Content Mapping to Standard Template

### 2.1 Well-Structured Specifications

These specifications already follow a structure similar to the standard template:

1. **AUTOMATED_BACKUP_SERVICE_SPEC.md** (90% compliance)
   - Has clear sections for Overview, Objectives, User Stories, Scope, Requirements
   - Missing only minor template-specific sections

2. **SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS_SYSTEM_SPEC.md** (95% compliance)
   - Comprehensive structure with all major sections
   - Excellent example of well-documented specification

3. **specs/03_frontend/pages/dashboard.md** (80% compliance)
   - Good component hierarchy and specifications
   - Missing some standard template sections

4. **specs/02_architecture/services/api_gateway.md** (85% compliance)
   - Good technical details and API specifications
   - Missing user stories and traceability

### 2.2 Partially Structured Specifications

These have some structure but need significant reorganization:

1. **Functional Requirements (FRs)**
   - Have basic requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Missing proper user story format and traceability
   - Need better organization and completeness

2. **Data Models**
   - Have schema definitions
   - Missing business logic, API endpoints, and user stories
   - Need more context and implementation details

3. **Service Architecture**
   - Have technical specifications
   - Missing user stories, testing strategies, and deployment details

### 2.3 Poorly Structured Specifications

These need complete restructuring:

1. **User Stories**
   - Very basic structure
   - Missing detailed acceptance criteria
   - Need proper format and traceability

2. **Backend specifications**
   - Duplicates of other specs with minimal added value
   - Inconsistent structure
   - Consider consolidation or removal

## 3. Missing Information Analysis

### 3.1 Common Missing Sections

| Section                        | Missing In | Priority |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| User Stories (proper format)   | Most specs | High     |
| Acceptance Criteria (detailed) | Most specs | High     |
| Traceability Links             | All specs  | High     |
| Testing Strategy               | Most specs | Medium   |
| Performance Requirements       | Most specs | Medium   |
| Security Considerations        | Most specs | High     |
| Implementation Notes           | Most specs | Medium   |

### 3.2 Critical Issues Identified

1. **Template Inconsistency**
   - Each spec follows different structure
   - Makes maintenance and review difficult
   - Reduces overall quality and usability

2. **Missing Traceability**
   - No links between requirements and implementation
   - Difficult to track feature completion
   - Hinders impact analysis

3. **Insufficient Testing Details**
   - Most specs lack comprehensive testing strategies
   - No clear acceptance criteria
   - Risk of quality issues

4. **Incomplete User Stories**
   - Most don't follow proper "As a... I want... So that..." format
   - Missing detailed acceptance criteria
   - Reduces clarity for development team
