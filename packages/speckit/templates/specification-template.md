# {{Feature Name}} Specification

## Overview and Context

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Provide a high-level overview of the feature and its business context
  TIPS: 
  - Explain why this feature is needed
  - Describe the business value and benefits
  - Mention any relevant background information
  - Keep this section concise but informative
-->

{{Provide a brief overview of the feature, its purpose, and business context. Explain why this feature is needed and what value it brings to the users and the business.}}

## User Stories

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Define user needs in a standardized format
  TIPS:
  - Use the exact format: "As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"
  - Each user story should focus on a single user need
  - Include acceptance criteria in Gherkin format (Given-When-Then)
  - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
-->

### User Story 1: {{User Story Title}}

**As a** {{user type}}, **I want to** {{perform action}}, **so that** {{achieve benefit}}.

#### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: {{Scenario description}}
  Given {{precondition}}
  When {{action is taken}}
  Then {{expected outcome}}
  And {{additional outcome}}

Scenario: {{Alternative scenario or edge case}}
  Given {{different precondition}}
  When {{different action is taken}}
  Then {{different expected outcome}}
```

### User Story 2: {{User Story Title}}

**As a** {{user type}}, **I want to** {{perform action}}, **so that** {{achieve benefit}}.

#### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: {{Scenario description}}
  Given {{precondition}}
  When {{action is taken}}
  Then {{expected outcome}}
```

## Functional Requirements

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Define specific system behaviors and functions
  TIPS:
  - Use clear, unambiguous language with modal verbs (shall, must, should)
  - Make requirements measurable and testable
  - Include traceability links to user stories
  - Consider both happy path and error scenarios
-->

### FR-{{sequence-number}}: {{Requirement Title}}

{{specification-id}} shall {{describe the required behavior}}.

**Traceability:** Links to user story {{user-story-id}}

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- {{Specific criterion 1}}
- {{Specific criterion 2}}
- {{Specific criterion 3}}

### FR-{{sequence-number}}: {{Requirement Title}}

{{specification-id}} must {{describe the mandatory behavior}}.

**Traceability:** Links to user story {{user-story-id}}

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- {{Specific criterion 1}}
- {{Specific criterion 2}}

## Non-Functional Requirements

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Define quality attributes and system constraints
  TIPS:
  - Include measurable criteria for each requirement
  - Cover performance, security, usability, reliability aspects
  - Make requirements specific and testable
-->

### Performance Requirements

- **Response Time:** System shall respond to user actions within {{X}} seconds
- **Throughput:** System shall handle {{X}} concurrent users
- **Resource Usage:** Memory usage shall not exceed {{X}} MB

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication:** System shall authenticate users using {{authentication method}}
- **Authorization:** System shall enforce role-based access control
- **Data Protection:** Sensitive data shall be encrypted using {{encryption standard}}

### Usability Requirements

- **Ease of Use:** New users shall be able to complete {{task}} within {{X}} minutes without training
- **Accessibility:** System shall comply with {{accessibility standard}} (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Reliability Requirements

- **Availability:** System shall be available {{X}}% of the time
- **Error Handling:** System shall recover from errors within {{X}} seconds

## Constraints and Assumptions

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Document limitations and assumptions that affect the implementation
  TIPS:
  - Be specific about technical, business, or regulatory constraints
  - List all assumptions that could impact the implementation
  - Consider dependencies on external systems or resources
-->

### Constraints

- **Technical Constraints:** {{Technical limitations or requirements}}
- **Business Constraints:** {{Business rules or limitations}}
- **Regulatory Constraints:** {{Legal or regulatory requirements}}
- **Time Constraints:** {{Deadline or time-related limitations}}

### Assumptions

- **Technical Assumptions:** {{Assumptions about technology or infrastructure}}
- **Business Assumptions:** {{Assumptions about business processes or user behavior}}
- **Resource Assumptions:** {{Assumptions about available resources or skills}}

## Dependencies and Related Specifications

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Document relationships with other specifications and external dependencies
  TIPS:
  - Include both internal and external dependencies
  - Specify the nature of each dependency
  - Consider impact of dependency changes
-->

### Internal Dependencies

- **{{dependency-spec-id}}:** {{Description of dependency relationship}}
- **{{dependency-spec-id}}:** {{Description of dependency relationship}}

### External Dependencies

- **{{external-system-name}}:** {{Description of external dependency and interface requirements}}
- **{{third-party-service}}:** {{Description of third-party service dependency}}

### Related Specifications

- **{{related-spec-id}}:** {{Description of relationship and impact}}
- **{{related-spec-id}}:** {{Description of relationship and impact}}

## Data Model

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Define data structures and relationships (if applicable)
  TIPS:
  - Include field names, types, and constraints
  - Define relationships between entities
  - Consider validation rules and business logic
-->

### {{Entity Name}}

| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| {{field-name}} | {{data-type}} | {{constraints}} | {{description}} |
| {{field-name}} | {{data-type}} | {{constraints}} | {{description}} |
| {{field-name}} | {{data-type}} | {{constraints}} | {{description}} |

### Relationships

- **{{Entity1}}** has many **{{Entity2}}** (One-to-Many)
- **{{Entity3}}** belongs to **{{Entity4}}** (Many-to-One)

## API Specification (if applicable)

<!-- 
  PURPOSE: Define API endpoints and contracts (if applicable)
  TIPS:
