# User Authentication Specification

## Overview and Context

This specification defines the user authentication functionality for the Smart AI Hub platform. Authentication is a critical security feature that enables users to securely access their accounts and protected resources. The system will support email/password authentication with JWT tokens for session management.

The authentication system will provide a secure, user-friendly login experience while maintaining high security standards to protect user accounts and sensitive data. This feature is essential for establishing user identity and enabling personalized experiences within the platform.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: User Login

**As a** registered user, **I want to** log in with my email and password, **so that** I can access my account and protected resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given I am a registered user with valid credentials
  When I enter my email and password correctly
  Then I should be redirected to my dashboard
  And I should receive a valid JWT token
  And I should see a success message

Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
  Given I am a registered user
  When I enter my correct email but incorrect password
  Then I should remain on the login page
  And I should see an error message "Invalid email or password"
  And I should not receive a JWT token

Scenario: Failed login with non-existent email
  Given I enter an email that does not exist in the system
  When I enter any password
  Then I should remain on the login page
  And I should see an error message "Invalid email or password"
  And I should not receive a JWT token

Scenario: Account locked after multiple failed attempts
  Given I have failed to login 5 times with incorrect credentials
  When I attempt to login again
  Then I should see an error message "Account locked due to multiple failed attempts"
  And I should not be able to attempt login for 30 minutes
```

### User Story 2: Session Management

**As a** logged-in user, **I want to** remain logged in across browser sessions, **so that** I don't have to log in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Persistent session with remember me
  Given I am logged in with "Remember me" option selected
  When I close my browser and reopen it
  Then I should still be logged in
  And I should be able to access protected resources

Scenario: Session expiration
  Given I am logged in without "Remember me" option
  When my session expires after 24 hours
  Then I should be automatically logged out
  And I should be redirected to the login page
  And I should see a message "Your session has expired"
```

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- Use JWT with RS256 algorithm for token signing
- Implement token rotation for enhanced security
- Store refresh tokens in Redis with TTL
- Use exponential backoff for rate limiting

### Implementation Approach

Implement authentication as a microservice with separate endpoints for login, logout, and token refresh. Use middleware for token validation on protected routes.
