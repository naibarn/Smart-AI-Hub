# Multi-Tier Hierarchy and Referral System

## 1. Overview

The Smart AI Hub Multi-Tier Hierarchy and Referral System is a comprehensive user management platform that implements a structured five-tier hierarchy with strict visibility controls, transfer capabilities, referral functionality, and administrative features. This system enables organizations to manage complex user relationships while maintaining security through role-based access controls and visibility restrictions. The architecture supports Agencies managing multiple Organizations, Organizations managing Admins and Generals, and Admins managing General users, all with appropriate permissions and visibility constraints. The referral system provides flexible reward mechanisms that incentivize user growth while the transfer system enables secure point and credit movements within the hierarchy boundaries.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of the Multi-Tier Hierarchy and Referral System are to establish a scalable organizational structure that supports complex business relationships, implement strict data access controls to prevent unauthorized information disclosure, provide flexible transfer mechanisms for points and credits within hierarchy boundaries, create a comprehensive referral system with configurable rewards, and maintain complete audit trails for all administrative actions. The system aims to balance operational flexibility with security requirements, ensuring that users can only access and interact with data and users within their designated visibility scope. Additionally, the system must support high-volume operations with sub-second response times while maintaining data consistency and integrity across all operations.

## 3. User Stories

As an Administrator, I want to view and manage all users in the system so that I can maintain platform security and resolve user issues. As an Agency administrator, I want to create and manage multiple Organizations under my agency so that I can structure my business operations effectively. As an Organization administrator, I want to manage Admins and General users within my organization so that I can control access to resources and maintain proper oversight. As an Admin, I want to manage General users in my organization and transfer points to them so that I can support their activities and ensure smooth operations. As a General user, I want to refer new users to the platform and receive rewards so that I can benefit from growing the user base. As an Agency administrator, I want to configure referral rewards for different user tiers so that I can incentivize specific types of user growth. As a user at any tier, I want to transfer points and credits to users I can see so that I can support my team members and subordinates. As a user, I want to be able to block inappropriate users within my management scope so that I can maintain a safe environment.

## 4. Scope

The Multi-Tier Hierarchy and Referral System includes implementation of a five-tier user hierarchy (Administrator, Agency, Organization, Admin, General), visibility rules that restrict data access based on hierarchy relationships, point and credit transfer functionality with authorization checks, a comprehensive referral system with configurable rewards, block/unblock functionality with proper authorization, and complete audit trails for all administrative actions. The system includes API endpoints for all hierarchy management operations, middleware for visibility enforcement, database schema for all hierarchy-related entities, and administrative interfaces for management tasks. The system excludes multi-level referral commissions (only direct referrals are rewarded), advanced analytics beyond basic statistics, automated tier promotion based on performance metrics, integration with external CRM systems, and blockchain-based transaction verification.

## 9. Business Logic

### 9.1 Visibility Enforcement Logic

The visibility system is implemented through a middleware function that evaluates each user request against a set of hierarchical rules. The system first determines the current user's tier and hierarchy position, then applies the appropriate visibility filter based on the requested operation. For list operations, the system constructs database queries that automatically filter results based on visibility rules. For detail operations, the system performs explicit visibility checks before returning user data. This approach ensures that visibility rules are consistently enforced across all API endpoints and cannot be bypassed through direct database access.

### 9.2 Transfer Authorization Logic

Transfer operations follow a strict authorization matrix that defines which tiers can transfer to which other tiers. The system first validates that the sender can see the recipient through the visibility system, then checks the transfer authorization rules based on both user tiers. Administrator tier users can transfer to any user in the system. Agency tier users can transfer to their Organizations and any General users. Organization tier users can transfer to Admins and Generals within their organization. Admin tier users can transfer to Generals within the same organization. General tier users cannot initiate transfers to other users.

### 9.3 Referral Reward Distribution Logic

Referral rewards are calculated based on a combination of referrer tier, referee tier, and Agency configuration. When a new user registers with an invite code, the system identifies the referrer and determines the appropriate reward amounts. If the referrer is an Agency, the reward is deducted from the Agency's balance and distributed according to their configuration. For other referrers, the system applies standard reward amounts. The referral reward transaction is recorded with complete context about the referral relationship, and both referrer and referee receive notifications about the reward distribution.

### 9.4 Block/Unblock Processing Logic

Block operations are processed through a validation sequence that checks both authorization and visibility rules. The system first validates that the blocker has permission to block the target user based on their tiers and hierarchy relationship. If authorized, the system updates the user's block status and creates a BlockLog record with complete context. The system then terminates any active sessions for the blocked user and invalidates their authentication tokens. Unblock operations reverse this process, restoring the user's access and creating a corresponding BlockLog entry.

### 9.5 Hierarchy Relationship Management

Hierarchy relationships are maintained through a combination of foreign key relationships and validation rules. When a user is created or updated, the system validates that the hierarchy relationships are consistent with the tier assignments. Organizations must be associated with an Agency, Admins and Generals must be associated with an Organization, and circular references are prevented through validation checks. The system maintains referential integrity through database constraints while providing flexibility for organizational restructuring through administrative interfaces.

## 10. Security Considerations

### 10.1 Visibility Rule Enforcement

All visibility rules must be enforced server-side through middleware functions that cannot be bypassed by client applications. The system must implement defense-in-depth strategies that apply visibility filters at multiple layers, including database query construction, response sanitization, and API-level validation. Visibility checks must be performed before any user data is returned, and attempts to bypass visibility rules must be logged and monitored for potential security threats.

### 10.2 Transfer Security

Transfer operations must implement comprehensive security measures including balance validation, authorization checks, and transaction atomicity. The system must prevent unauthorized transfers through both visibility checks and explicit authorization validation. All transfers must be processed within database transactions to ensure that balance updates are atomic and consistent. The system must implement rate limiting on transfer endpoints to prevent abuse and potential financial losses.

### 10.3 Administrative Security

Administrative functions must require elevated permissions and implement additional security measures including multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations. All administrative actions must be logged with complete context including the administrator's identity, the action performed, the target of the action, and the justification. The system must implement segregation of duties that prevents administrators from modifying their own permissions or bypassing audit trails.

### 10.4 Data Protection

Sensitive user data must be protected through access controls, encryption at rest, and secure transmission protocols. The system must implement data sanitization that removes sensitive information from API responses based on the viewer's permissions. Personal information must be protected in accordance with data protection regulations, and users must have the ability to request data export or deletion in accordance with applicable laws.

### 10.5 Input Validation and Injection Prevention

All API inputs must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks including SQL injection, NoSQL injection, and cross-site scripting. The system must implement parameterized queries for all database operations and sanitize all user-provided data before processing. Input validation must check for appropriate data types, length restrictions, and format requirements before processing any user input.

## 11. Error Handling

### 11.1 Visibility Violation Errors

When a user attempts to access data outside their visibility scope, the system returns a 403 Forbidden error with a generic message that does not reveal the existence of the restricted data. The error is logged with complete context for security monitoring, but the response to the user remains generic to prevent information disclosure. Repeated visibility violations trigger rate limiting and potential account suspension.

### 11.2 Transfer Authorization Errors

Transfer operations that fail authorization checks return a 403 Forbidden error with a specific message indicating that the transfer is not permitted. The error response includes information about why the transfer was not authorized, such as insufficient permissions or visibility restrictions. The system logs all failed transfer attempts for security monitoring and potential fraud detection.

### 11.3 Insufficient Balance Errors

When a transfer would result in a negative balance, the system returns a 402 Payment Required error with information about the current balance and the attempted transfer amount. The error response includes suggestions for resolving the issue, such as purchasing more credits or points. The system logs insufficient balance attempts to monitor for potential abuse or financial issues.

### 11.4 Referral Code Errors

Invalid or expired referral codes return a 400 Bad Request error with information about why the code could not be applied. The system prevents enumeration of valid referral codes through consistent error messages and rate limiting. When referral rewards cannot be applied due to insufficient referrer balance, the system returns an appropriate error while still allowing user registration.

### 11.5 Block Operation Errors

Unauthorized block attempts return a 403 Forbidden error with information about the authorization failure. The system logs all unauthorized block attempts for security monitoring. When attempting to block a user who cannot be blocked due to hierarchy rules, the system provides a clear error message explaining the restriction.

## 12. Performance Requirements

### 12.1 Response Time Requirements

All user hierarchy operations must complete within 200ms for the 95th percentile of requests. Visibility check operations must complete within 50ms to ensure they do not impact overall system performance. Transfer operations must complete within 300ms due to their additional validation requirements. Administrative operations may have slightly higher response time requirements but should not exceed 500ms for typical operations.

### 12.2 Throughput Requirements

The system must support a sustained throughput of 1,000 hierarchy operations per minute. During peak usage periods, the system must handle burst loads of up to 5,000 operations per minute for short durations. Transfer operations must support 500 transfers per minute with proper validation and authorization. The system must maintain performance during concurrent operations from multiple users.

### 12.3 Database Performance

Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing on user IDs, hierarchy relationships, and visibility filters. The database must support complex join operations for hierarchy traversal without performance degradation. Connection pooling must be configured to handle the expected query load, and read replicas must be utilized for read-intensive operations.

### 12.4 Caching Performance

Frequently accessed hierarchy data must be cached to improve performance. User hierarchy relationships should be cached with appropriate invalidation when changes occur. Visibility check results should be cached for short periods to improve performance while maintaining data freshness. Referral statistics and other expensive calculations should be cached and updated periodically.

## 13. Deployment Strategy

### 13.1 Environment Configuration

The Multi-Tier Hierarchy and Referral System requires configuration of several environment variables for proper operation: `HIERARCHY_VISIBILITY_CACHE_TTL` (default: 300 seconds), `TRANSFER_RATE_LIMIT` (default: 10 per minute), `REFERRAL_CODE_LENGTH` (default: 8), `MAX_TRANSFER_AMOUNT` (default: 100,000 points), and `BLOCK_REASON_REQUIRED` (default: true). Database connection strings for both primary and replica instances must be configured for optimal performance.

### 13.2 Database Migration

Database schema changes must be applied through migration scripts that maintain backward compatibility. The migration process must include validation steps to ensure data integrity after schema changes. Hierarchy relationship data must be validated during migration to prevent orphaned users or inconsistent relationships. Rollback procedures must be tested and documented for all migrations.

### 13.3 Service Deployment

The hierarchy service should be deployed as part of the core service microservice architecture. Service health checks must be implemented to monitor proper operation of visibility checks, transfer processing, and referral functionality. Deployment should follow a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime during updates.

### 13.4 Caching Infrastructure

Redis must be deployed with appropriate memory allocation and persistence configuration for caching hierarchy data and visibility check results. Redis clustering should be implemented for high availability and scalability. Cache invalidation strategies must be implemented to ensure data consistency when hierarchy relationships change.

### 13.5 Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring must be implemented for all hierarchy system metrics, including visibility check performance, transfer success rates, referral conversion rates, and block operation frequency. Alerts must be configured for critical conditions such as visibility check failures, unusual transfer patterns, or security violations.

## 14. Testing Strategy

### 14.1 Unit Testing

All hierarchy service functions must have unit tests with a minimum code coverage of 90%. Tests must cover visibility rule enforcement for all tier combinations, transfer authorization logic, referral reward calculations, and block/unblock operations. Mock implementations should be used for external dependencies to ensure test isolation.

### 14.2 Integration Testing

Integration tests must verify the interaction between the hierarchy system and external dependencies including the database, caching layer, and notification services. Tests must validate visibility enforcement across all API endpoints, transfer transaction integrity, and referral reward distribution. End-to-end hierarchy workflows must be tested comprehensively.

### 14.3 Security Testing

Security testing must include validation of visibility rule enforcement to prevent data leakage. Tests should verify that users cannot access data outside their visibility scope through any means. Transfer authorization should be tested to prevent unauthorized transfers. Administrative functions should be tested to ensure proper access controls.

### 14.4 Performance Testing

Load testing must be conducted to validate that the system meets the specified performance requirements under expected and peak loads. Stress testing should be performed to identify system breaking points and ensure graceful degradation. Visibility check performance must be validated with realistic hierarchy data volumes.

### 14.5 User Acceptance Testing

User acceptance testing must validate that the hierarchy system meets business requirements and provides a positive user experience. Tests should include scenarios for user management, transfer operations, referral functionality, and administrative tasks. Visibility restrictions should be tested to ensure they work as expected without impacting legitimate user activities.

## 15. Documentation Requirements

### 15.1 API Documentation

Complete API documentation must be maintained using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. Documentation must include all endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and error conditions. Examples for all tier combinations and visibility scenarios should be provided to clarify the system behavior.

### 15.2 Hierarchy System Documentation

Comprehensive documentation must describe the hierarchy model, visibility rules, and transfer authorization matrix. Documentation should include clear examples of what each tier can see and do. Administrative procedures for managing hierarchy relationships must be documented with step-by-step instructions.

### 15.3 Security Documentation

Security documentation must explain the visibility enforcement mechanisms, access controls, and audit procedures. Documentation should include guidelines for secure deployment and monitoring. Security incident response procedures must be documented for hierarchy-related security events.

### 15.4 User Documentation

User-facing documentation must explain the hierarchy structure, transfer capabilities, and referral functionality from the user's perspective. Different documentation should be provided for each user tier to explain their specific capabilities and limitations. Frequently asked questions should address common hierarchy-related questions.

### 15.5 Administrative Documentation

Administrative documentation must provide detailed instructions for managing the hierarchy system including user tier modifications, transfer monitoring, and security auditing. Documentation should include troubleshooting procedures for common hierarchy-related issues and contact information for escalation paths.

## 16. Examples and Use Cases

### 16.1 Agency Management Use Case

An Agency administrator creates a new Organization and assigns an Admin to manage it. The Agency configures referral rewards for different user tiers: 5,000 points for Organization signups, 3,000 points for Admin signups, and 1,000 points for General signups. The Agency then transfers 50,000 points to the new Organization to fund initial operations. All these actions are logged and visible to the Agency administrator through the management interface.

### 16.2 Referral Reward Distribution Use Case

A General user shares their invite code with a friend who registers as an Organization. The system automatically identifies the referral relationship and distributes rewards: the new Organization receives 1,000 points as a base reward, the Agency of the Organization receives 5,000 points as configured, and the referring General user receives 2,000 points as a referral reward. All transactions are recorded with complete audit trails.

### 16.3 Visibility Enforcement Use Case

An Admin user attempts to view a user in another Organization through the API. The visibility middleware intercepts the request, determines that the Admin cannot see users outside their Organization, and returns a 403 Forbidden error. The attempt is logged for security monitoring, but no information about the restricted user is revealed to prevent information disclosure.

### 16.4 Transfer Authorization Use Case

An Organization administrator attempts to transfer points to an Admin in a different Organization. The transfer authorization system checks both visibility and authorization rules, determines that the transfer is not permitted, and returns an appropriate error message. The Organization administrator is informed that they can only transfer to users within their own Organization.

### 16.5 Block Operation Use Case

An Agency administrator identifies an Organization that is violating platform terms of service. The Agency administrator initiates a block operation, providing a reason for the block. The system validates the authorization, updates the Organization's status to blocked, terminates all active sessions, and creates a BlockLog record with complete context. The Organization can no longer access the platform, and all its members are effectively blocked until the Organization is unblocked.
