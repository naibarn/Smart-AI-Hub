## Key Findings Summary

### Overall Compliance Score: 45%

- **Specification Documents Found**: 2/6 (Critical Issue)
- **Spec Kit Compliance**: 35-40% (Critical Issue)
- **Points System Specification**: 0% (Critical Issue)
- **Hierarchy System Documentation**: 35-40% (Needs Improvement)
- **Security Documentation**: 70-90% (Good)

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Missing Points System Specification** - Core feature completely undocumented
2. **Missing Hierarchy System Specification** - Implementation exists without formal requirements
3. **User Visibility Implementation Verification** - Security-critical feature not verified
4. **Non-compliant Document Structure** - Documents don't follow Spec Kit 16-section format
