## Compliance Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Sections (Week 1)

1. Add Objectives section to both documents
2. Add User Stories section to both documents
3. Add Functional Requirements section to both documents

### Phase 2: High Priority Sections (Week 2)

1. Add Scope section to both documents
2. Add Non-Functional Requirements section to both documents
3. Enhance existing sections with missing details

### Phase 3: Remaining Sections (Week 3)

1. Add remaining sections to both documents
2. Review and validate compliance
3. Create new specification documents for missing features

---

## Conclusion

Both documents show good technical depth in certain areas but lack the comprehensive structure required by Spec Kit standards. The database schema and API endpoints are well-documented, but critical sections like Objectives, User Stories, and Functional Requirements are completely missing.

By following the improvement plan and using the provided template, the documents can be brought into full compliance with Spec Kit standards, providing comprehensive specifications for development teams.

**Target Compliance**: 100% (16/16 sections)  
**Current Compliance**: 35-40% (5-6/16 sections)  
**Improvement Needed**: Significant restructuring and content addition
