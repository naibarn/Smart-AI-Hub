# RBAC Schema Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the Prisma schema and related code to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with many-to-many relationships between users and roles, and between roles and permissions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Schema Changes

#### User Model

- Changed `emailVerified` to `verified` (boolean field)
- Removed `roleId` (single role reference)
- Added many-to-many relationship with roles via `UserRole` junction table

#### Role Model

- Removed JSON `permissions` field
- Added `isSystem` boolean field (default: false)
- Added many-to-many relationship with permissions via `RolePermission` junction table

#### New Permission Model

- Created new `Permission` model with `resource` and `action` fields
- Linked to Role via `RolePermission` junction table

#### CreditAccount Model

- Changed from multiple fields (`currentBalance`, `totalPurchased`, `totalUsed`) to single `balance` field
- Simplified the credit tracking mechanism

#### New Junction Tables

- `UserRole` (userId, roleId, assignedAt)
- `RolePermission` (roleId, permissionId, grantedAt)

### 2. Migration Strategy

- Created migration files for both auth-service and core-service
- Implemented data transformation logic to preserve existing data
- Used raw SQL queries to handle schema transitions safely
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition

### 3. Code Updates

#### Auth Service (packages/auth-service)

- Updated `User.js` model to support multiple roles and permissions
- Modified `auth.controller.js` to handle new user structure with roles array
- Updated `user.controller.js` with role assignment and permission methods
- Modified `credit.controller.js` to work with new credit account structure

#### Core Service (packages/core-service)

- Updated `credit.service.ts` to work with simplified balance field
- Modified `permission.service.ts` to support RBAC operations
- Updated `rbac.middleware.ts` to check permissions via database
- Modified `auth.middleware.ts` to support roles array in JWT payload

### 4. Migration Files Created

#### Auth Service Migration

- `packages/auth-service/prisma/migrations/20240101000000_refactor_to_rbac_schema/migration.sql`
- Includes comprehensive data transformation logic

#### Core Service Migration

- `packages/core-service/prisma/migrations/20240101000001_refactor_to_rbac_schema/migration.sql`
- Aligns core-service schema with auth-service

## Benefits of the New RBAC System

1. **Flexible Role Management**: Users can have multiple roles
2. **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained control over user actions
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new roles and permissions
4. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships
5. **Audit Trail**: Timestamps for role assignments and permission grants

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for all updated models and services
2. Integration tests for RBAC middleware
3. Migration tests to verify data preservation
4. API endpoint tests for new functionality

## Rollback Plan

1. Migration rollback files created for both services
2. Data transformation logic is reversible
3. Backup procedures documented

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing of all updated components
2. Update API documentation
3. Create admin interface for role/permission management
4. Deploy to staging environment for final verification
