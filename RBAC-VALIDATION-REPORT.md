# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Validation Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the frontend implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the Smart AI Hub application. The assessment reveals that while the backend has a well-defined RBAC structure with proper data models, the frontend currently lacks implementation of role-based UI visibility controls.

## RBAC Requirements Analysis

### Permission Matrix (from FR-2)

| Role        | View Dashboard | Use AI Services | Manage Users | Adjust Credits | System Config |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| Super Admin | ✓              | ✓               | ✓            | ✓              | ✓             |
| Admin       | ✓              | ✓               | ✓            | ✓              | -             |
| Manager     | ✓              | ✓               | Team only    | Team only      | -             |
| User        | ✓              | ✓               | -            | -              | -             |

## Backend RBAC Structure

### Data Models Analysis

The backend has a well-structured RBAC system with the following models:

1. **Role Model** (`specs/02_architecture/data_models/role.md`)
   - Fields: id, name, description
   - Relationships: users, permissions

2. **Permission Model** (`specs/02_architecture/data_models/permission.md`)
   - Fields: id, name, resource, action
   - Supports granular permissions (create, read, update, delete)

3. **UserRole Model** (`specs/02_architecture/data_models/user_role.md`)
   - Many-to-many relationship between users and roles
   - Tracks assignment timestamp

4. **RolePermission Model** (`specs/02_architecture/data_models/role_permission.md`)
   - Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions

### Backend Services

The `coreService` in the frontend provides the following RBAC-related API methods:

- `getUserRoles()`: Retrieve user roles
- `getUserPermissions()`: Retrieve user permissions
- `hasPermission(resource, action)`: Check specific permissions

## Frontend RBAC Implementation Analysis

### Current State: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. Authentication State Management

**Issue**: The Redux store in `App.tsx` only tracks basic authentication state without role information.

```typescript
// Current implementation only tracks basic auth
auth: {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    avatar?: string;
  } | null;
}
```

**Missing**: Role and permission information is not stored in the application state.

#### 2. Navigation Components

**Sidebar.tsx**:

- ❌ No role-based filtering of menu items
- All navigation items are statically defined and visible to all authenticated users
- Missing implementation for "Manage Users", "Adjust Credits", and "System Config" options

**NavBar.tsx**:

- ❌ No role-based menu options in user profile dropdown
- Standard menu items (Profile, Credits, Settings, Logout) shown to all users

#### 3. Dashboard Component

**Dashboard.tsx**:

- ❌ No role-based UI elements
- All dashboard sections (stats, credit balance, team members) shown to all users
- Missing conditional rendering for administrative functions

#### 4. Authentication Service

**auth.service.ts**:

- ❌ User model doesn't include role information
- Login response doesn't return user roles or permissions

**core.service.ts**:

- ✅ API methods exist for RBAC operations
- ❌ Not being used anywhere in the frontend

#### 5. Route Protection

**App.tsx**:

- ❌ No role-based route protection
- All authenticated users can access all routes
- Missing implementation for admin-only routes

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. No Role-Based UI Visibility

- Administrative functions are not hidden from non-admin users
- All users see the same interface regardless of their role

### 2. Missing Permission Checking

- Frontend doesn't validate user permissions before showing features
- No implementation of granular permission checks

### 3. Incomplete Authentication State

- User roles and permissions are not stored in application state
- No mechanism to update UI when roles change

### 4. Static Navigation

- Sidebar and navigation don't adapt to user permissions
- Missing menu items for administrative functions

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Update Authentication State

```typescript
interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    avatar?: string;
    roles: Role[];
    permissions: Permission[];
  } | null;
}
```

### 2. Create Permission Hooks

```typescript
// hooks/usePermissions.ts
export const usePermissions = () => {
  const { user } = useSelector((state) => state.auth);

  const hasPermission = (resource: string, action: string) => {
    return user?.permissions.some((p) => p.resource === resource && p.action === action) || false;
  };

  const hasRole = (roleName: string) => {
    return user?.roles.some((r) => r.name === roleName) || false;
  };

  return { hasPermission, hasRole };
};
```

### 3. Implement Role-Based Navigation

Update `Sidebar.tsx` to filter menu items based on permissions:

```typescript
const filteredSidebarItems = sidebarItems.filter((item) => {
  if (item.requiredRole) {
    return hasRole(item.requiredRole);
  }
  if (item.requiredPermission) {
    return hasPermission(item.requiredPermission.resource, item.requiredPermission.action);
  }
  return true;
});
```

### 4. Add Administrative Menu Items

```typescript
const adminMenuItems = [
  {
    id: 'manage-users',
    label: 'Manage Users',
    icon: <Users size={20} />,
    path: '/admin/users',
    requiredRole: 'admin'
  },
  {
    id: 'adjust-credits',
    label: 'Adjust Credits',
    icon: <CreditCard size={20} />,
    path: '/admin/credits',
    requiredPermission: { resource: 'credits', action: 'update' }
  },
  {
    id: 'system-config',
    label: 'System Config',
    icon: <Settings size={20} />,
    path: '/admin/settings',
    requiredRole: 'super-admin'
  }
];
```

### 5. Implement Route Guards

```typescript
// components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
const ProtectedRoute: React.FC<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
  requiredRole?: string;
  requiredPermission?: { resource: string; action: string };
}> = ({ children, requiredRole, requiredPermission }) => {
  const { hasRole, hasPermission } = usePermissions();

  if (requiredRole && !hasRole(requiredRole)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }

  if (requiredPermission && !hasPermission(requiredPermission.resource, requiredPermission.action)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

### 6. Update Dashboard with Role-Based Sections

```typescript
// Admin-only sections
{hasRole('admin') && (
  <Grid item xs={12}>
    <AdminDashboard />
  </Grid>
)}

// Team management for managers
{hasRole('manager') && (
  <Grid item xs={12}>
    <TeamManagement />
  </Grid>
)}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Role Validation

1. Login as Admin user
2. Verify "Manage Users" appears in sidebar
3. Verify "Adjust Credits" appears in sidebar
4. Verify "System Config" does NOT appear (Super Admin only)
5. Verify admin-only dashboard sections are visible

### Scenario 2: User Role Validation

1. Login as regular User
2. Verify "Manage Users" does NOT appear in sidebar
3. Verify "Adjust Credits" does NOT appear in sidebar
4. Verify "System Config" does NOT appear in sidebar
5. Verify admin-only dashboard sections are hidden

### Scenario 3: Manager Role Validation

1. Login as Manager
2. Verify "Manage Users" appears but is limited to team members
3. Verify "Adjust Credits" appears but is limited to team credits
4. Verify "System Config" does NOT appear

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Update authentication state to include roles and permissions
2. **High Priority**: Create permission checking hooks
3. **High Priority**: Implement role-based navigation filtering
4. **Medium Priority**: Add administrative menu items
5. **Medium Priority**: Implement route guards
6. **Low Priority**: Add role-based dashboard sections

## Conclusion

The frontend RBAC implementation is currently non-existent, representing a significant security and usability gap. While the backend has a proper RBAC structure, the frontend doesn't leverage it to control UI visibility. This means all authenticated users see the same interface, regardless of their actual permissions.

Implementing the recommended changes will ensure that:

- Users only see features they're authorized to access
- Administrative functions are properly protected
- The UI adapts to user roles and permissions
- The application follows the principle of least privilege

The implementation should follow the priority order outlined above, with authentication state updates and permission checking hooks being the first priority.
