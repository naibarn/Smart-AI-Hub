## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Never skip the rollback procedure** - Always have a tested rollback plan
2. **Monitor continuously** - Keep monitoring dashboards open during deployment
3. **Communicate early and often** - Keep all stakeholders informed
4. **Document everything** - Keep detailed records of all changes
5. **Test in staging first** - Never deploy to production without staging validation
6. **Have a backup** - Always have recent backups before making changes
7. **Check dependencies** - Verify all external services are available
8. **Plan for failure** - Assume something will go wrong and be prepared
