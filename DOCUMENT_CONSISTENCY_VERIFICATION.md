## ‚úÖ Verification Summary

The document consistency verification identified several inconsistencies across the project status documents, primarily in key metrics. The inconsistencies are concentrated in two documents (FINAL_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT_REPORT.md and PROJECT_STATUS_FINAL.md) and can be easily corrected.

The newly created documents (PROJECT_STATUS_LATEST.md, PROGRESS_SUMMARY_REPORT.md, METRICS_DASHBOARD.md, and PROJECT_ROADMAP.md) are all consistent with the recalculated metrics and serve as the source of truth for the updated values.

Once the identified corrections are applied, all documents will be 100% consistent, providing reliable information for stakeholders and decision-makers.

**Verification Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è INCONSISTENCIES IDENTIFIED
**Correction Required**: Yes (2 documents)
**Time to Resolution**: 30 minutes
**Next Review**: After corrections applied
