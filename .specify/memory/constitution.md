# Smart AI Hub Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Microservices Architecture

Every service MUST be independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable. Services communicate through well-defined APIs with clear contracts. Each service owns its data and exposes functionality through RESTful endpoints or event streams.

### II. API-First Development

All services MUST expose functionality through APIs first. APIs MUST be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. Text-based protocols (JSON over HTTP) are preferred for interoperability. Support both machine-readable and human-readable response formats.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is MANDATORY: Tests MUST be written before implementation code. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be strictly enforced. All services MUST have unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests with minimum 80% code coverage.

### IV. Integration & Contract Testing

Focus areas requiring comprehensive integration tests: Cross-service communication, Shared data models, API contract changes, Authentication/authorization flows, Database migrations. Contract tests MUST validate service boundaries.

### V. Observability & Monitoring

All services MUST implement structured logging with correlation IDs. Metrics MUST be exposed for health, performance, and business KPIs. Distributed tracing MUST be implemented for request flows across services. Alerting MUST be configured for critical failures.

### VI. Versioning & Compatibility

Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) MUST be followed for all services. Breaking changes require version bump and migration plan. Backward compatibility MUST be maintained for at least one previous version. Deprecation notices MUST be communicated 30 days in advance.

### VII. Security & Compliance

Security MUST be implemented in layers: authentication, authorization, input validation, and data encryption. All services MUST validate JWT tokens and enforce RBAC. Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. Regular security audits MUST be performed.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- TypeScript MUST be used for all new services with strict type checking
- ESLint and Prettier MUST be configured and enforced
- Code reviews MUST be required for all changes
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function
- Maximum function length of 50 lines

### Database Standards

- PostgreSQL MUST be used for relational data with Prisma ORM
- Database migrations MUST be version-controlled and reversible
- All queries MUST use parameterized statements
- Connection pooling MUST be configured appropriately
- Read replicas MUST be used for read-heavy workloads

### Performance Standards

- API response times MUST be under 200ms (p95)
- Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed
- Caching MUST be implemented for frequently accessed data
- Memory usage MUST be monitored and optimized
- Load testing MUST be performed for all endpoints

## Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Requirements

- All tests MUST pass with 100% success rate
- Code coverage MUST be at least 80%
- Security scan MUST produce no critical vulnerabilities
- Performance tests MUST meet defined benchmarks
- Documentation MUST be updated for all API changes

### Deployment Standards

- Blue-green deployments MUST be used for zero-downtime releases
- Health checks MUST be implemented for all services
- Rollback plans MUST be documented and tested
- Deployment scripts MUST be automated and idempotent
- Monitoring MUST be verified post-deployment

## Governance

### Amendment Process

- Constitution amendments require 2/3 maintainer approval
- All changes MUST be documented with rationale
- Migration plans MUST be provided for breaking changes
- Community feedback MUST be considered for major amendments
- Version history MUST be maintained in this file

### Compliance & Review

- All PRs MUST verify constitution compliance
- Complexity deviations MUST be explicitly justified
- Monthly reviews MUST assess constitution effectiveness
- Violations MUST be documented and addressed
- Exceptions require temporary waiver with expiration date

### Development Workflow

- Feature branches MUST follow naming convention: `feature/[###-description]`
- All features MUST have corresponding specification documents
- Tasks MUST be organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3)
- Each user story MUST be independently testable and deployable
- Code reviews MUST focus on architecture, security, and performance
