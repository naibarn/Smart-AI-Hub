# Points System User Guide

## Overview

The Points System is a new feature in Smart AI Hub that works alongside the existing Credits System. Points provide you with more flexibility in using our AI services, with multiple ways to earn and acquire them.

## What are Points?

Points are a virtual currency that you can use to access AI services on Smart AI Hub. They work independently from Credits but can be used interchangeably for most services.

When using any service, you'll see payment options:

### Checking Your Balance

Your Points balance is displayed in:

## Auto Top-up Feature

Never run out of Points unexpectedly! Our auto top-up feature automatically converts Credits to Points when your balance is low.

### How Auto Top-up Works

1. **Trigger**: When your Points balance ≤ 10
2. **Condition**: AND you have at least 1 Credit available
3. **Action**: Automatically convert 1 Credit to 1,000 Points
4. **Notification**: You'll receive a notification about the auto top-up
5. **Transaction**: Recorded in your transaction history

### Example Scenario

```
Initial state:
- Points: 8
- Credits: 5

You try to use a service that costs 100 Points:

1. System detects Points ≤ 10
2. Auto top-up triggers: 1 Credit → 1,000 Points
3. New balances: Points: 1,008, Credits: 4
4. Service cost deducted: Points: 908, Credits: 4
5. You can use the service successfully!
```

### Managing Auto Top-up

You can control auto top-up behavior in your settings:

- **Enable/Disable**: Turn the feature on or off
- **Threshold**: Set when auto top-up triggers (default: 10 Points)
- **Amount**: Set how many Credits to convert (default: 1 Credit)
