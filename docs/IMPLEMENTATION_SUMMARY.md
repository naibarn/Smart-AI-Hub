## Technical Architecture

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point with routing and load balancing
- **Core Service**: User management, authentication, and core business logic
- **RAG Service**: Document processing and semantic search
- **Pricing Service**: Cost calculation and credit management
- **Agent Skills Service**: Skill marketplace and management

### Frontend Application
- **React** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Material-UI** for consistent design system
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API communication

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL** for primary data storage
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database operations

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Nginx** for reverse proxy and SSL termination
- **PM2** for process management in production
- **Winston** for structured logging
- **Sentry** for error tracking and monitoring

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
5. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Database Indexing**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
3. **Lazy Loading**: Frontend components loaded on demand
4. **Code Splitting**: Frontend code split for faster initial load
5. **CDN**: Static assets served through CDN
6. **Connection Pooling**: Database connection pooling for efficiency

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health checks for all services
2. **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring
3. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
4. **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for error monitoring
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Request tracing and performance metrics

## Next Steps
