- **P1 (High)**: Core features for MVP, AI service integrations, user-facing components
- **P2 (Medium)**: Admin tools, secondary features, quality improvements
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have features, technical debt

### Remaining Work - Prioritized

| Priority | ID | Title | Current Status | Justification |
|----------|----|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **P0** | E6.2 | Production Deployment | Not Started | Critical for MVP launch - SSL, monitoring, automation |
| **P0** | E1.1 | Development Environment Setup | In Progress | Critical security and infrastructure - SSL, firewall, monitoring |
| **P0** | E3.2 | Credit Top-up System | Not Started | Critical for revenue generation - Stripe integration |
| **P1** | E4.3 | Claude Integration | Not Started | Core AI provider - multi-provider strategy, fallback |
| **P1** | E4.4 | MCP Authentication & Authorization | Not Started | Core security for AI services - permission checks, credit validation |
| **P1** | E5.2 | Authentication UI | Not Started | Core user-facing component - login, registration, verification |

| **P3** | FR-7 | Webhook System | Orphaned | Phase 2 feature - third-party integrations |

### Sprint 5 (Weeks 9-10) Recommendations

**Focus**: Complete MVP foundation and prepare for production launch

1. **Critical Path Items (Must Complete)**:
   - E6.2: Production Deployment (P0)
   - E3.2: Credit Top-up System (P0)
   - E4.3: Claude Integration (P1)
   - E4.4: MCP Authentication & Authorization (P1)

2. **User-Facing Components**:
   - E5.2: Authentication UI (P1)
   - E5.3: Dashboard UI (P1)

3. **Quality & Operations**:
   - E1.4: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (P1)
   - E1.5: Logging Infrastructure (P1)
   - E6.1: Testing Implementation (P1)

### Blockers and Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Stripe integration complexity | High | Use test mode, follow documentation closely |
| Claude API key configuration | Medium | Configure in Sprint 4.5, test thoroughly |
| Production deployment timeline | High | Start early, use staging environment |
| UI development timeline | Medium | Leverage MUI components, keep design simple |

## Summary

### Progress Highlights

- **59.1% of tasks completed** - Strong foundation in place
- **Core authentication system fully implemented** - JWT, OAuth, RBAC, email verification
- **Credit management system operational** - Balance tracking, transactions, promo codes
- **MCP server foundation ready** - WebSocket, authentication, OpenAI integration
- **Sora2 Video Generator integration completed** - Session-based auth, credit management

### Immediate Focus Areas

1. **Complete Claude integration** for multi-provider AI support
2. **Implement MCP authentication** for secure AI service access
3. **Build Credit Top-up system** for revenue generation
4. **Create Production Deployment** pipeline for MVP launch
5. **Develop User Interface** for authentication and dashboard

### Recommendation

The project is in excellent shape with solid foundations completed. Focus on the P0 and P1 items to complete the MVP. The current sprint (Sprint 4) should prioritize completing Claude integration and MCP authentication, while Sprint 5 should focus on payment processing, UI components, and production deployment.
