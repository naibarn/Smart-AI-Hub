Create a comprehensive Points System Specification document for Smart AI Hub following Spec Kit standards.

# Task: Create Points System Specification Document

## Objective
Create a complete specification document named `kilocode_points_system_spec.md` that follows the Spec Kit standard format with all 16 required sections. This document will serve as the authoritative specification for the Points System in Smart AI Hub.

## Context
Smart AI Hub already has a Points System implemented in the backend (packages/core-service/src/services/point.service.ts). This specification document needs to formalize the requirements, architecture, and implementation details to ensure compliance with Spec Kit standards and serve as documentation for future development.

## Requirements

### Document Structure
The specification MUST include all 16 sections as defined by Spec Kit standards:

1. **Overview** - High-level introduction to the Points System
2. **Objectives** - Clear goals and purposes of the system
3. **User Stories** - User-centric scenarios (minimum 5 stories)
4. **Scope** - What is included and excluded
5. **Functional Requirements** - Detailed feature requirements
6. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, scalability
7. **Data Models** - Database schema and relationships
8. **API Specifications** - Complete API endpoint documentation
9. **Business Logic** - Core algorithms and workflows
10. **Security Considerations** - Security measures and best practices
11. **Error Handling** - Error scenarios and handling strategies
12. **Performance Requirements** - Response times, throughput, scalability
13. **Deployment Strategy** - Deployment process and considerations
14. **Testing Strategy** - Test coverage and methodologies
15. **Documentation Requirements** - Required documentation artifacts
16. **Examples and Use Cases** - Real-world usage examples

### Content Requirements

The specification MUST cover the following Points System features:

#### 1. Points System Architecture
- Points account management
- Transaction tracking and history
- Balance calculation and caching
- Integration with Credits system

#### 2. Auto Top-up Feature
- **Trigger Condition**: Automatically top up when Points ≤ 10 (configurable threshold)
- **Action**: Deduct 1 Credit and add 1,000 Points
- **Exchange Rate**: 1 Credit = 1,000 Points (configurable)
- **Logging**: Record all auto top-up events in AutoTopupLog table
- **Notifications**: Notify user when auto top-up occurs
- **Configuration**: Admin can configure threshold and exchange amount

#### 3. Daily Login Rewards
- **Reward Amount**: Configurable points per day
- **Claim Mechanism**: One claim per day per user
- **Timezone Handling**: Respect user timezone for daily reset
- **Streak Tracking**: Track consecutive login days
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent multiple claims in same day

#### 4. Exchange Rate Configuration
- **Admin Management**: Admin can set and update exchange rates
- **Rate Types**: 
  - Credit-to-Points exchange rate
  - Money-to-Points purchase rate
- **History Tracking**: Track all rate changes
- **Effective Dates**: Support future-dated rate changes

#### 5. Purchase Points with Money
- **Payment Integration**: Support Stripe/PayPal
- **Pricing**: 10,000 Points = 1 USD (configurable)
- **Transaction Processing**: Atomic payment and points addition
- **Receipt Generation**: Generate receipt for purchases
- **Refund Handling**: Support refund scenarios

#### 6. Admin Management
- **Point Adjustments**: Admin can manually adjust user points
- **Audit Trail**: Log all admin actions
- **Statistics Dashboard**: View system-wide points statistics
- **User Management**: View and manage user point accounts

### Technical Specifications

#### Database Schema (Already Implemented)
Reference the existing Prisma schema:
- `PointAccount` - User point balances
- `PointTransaction` - Transaction history
- `ExchangeRate` - Configurable exchange rates
- `DailyLoginReward` - Daily reward tracking
- `AutoTopupLog` - Auto top-up event logs

#### API Endpoints (Already Implemented)
Document the existing APIs from `point.controller.ts`:
- `GET /api/v1/points/balance` - Get user point balance
- `POST /api/v1/points/exchange` - Exchange credits to points
- `POST /api/v1/points/purchase` - Purchase points with money
- `POST /api/v1/points/daily-reward` - Claim daily reward
- `GET /api/v1/points/history` - Get transaction history
- `POST /api/v1/points/deduct` - Deduct points (for services)
- `POST /api/v1/admin/points/adjust` - Admin point adjustment
- `GET /api/v1/admin/points/stats` - System statistics

#### Business Logic (Already Implemented)
Reference the existing implementation in `point.service.ts`:
- Balance management with Redis caching
- Transaction integrity with database transactions
- Auto top-up trigger mechanism
- Daily reward claim validation
- Exchange rate application

### Quality Standards

#### Writing Style
- Use professional, academic writing style
- Write in complete paragraphs, not bullet points (except for lists)
- Use tables to organize and compare information
- Include hyperlinks to relevant external resources
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key concepts
- Use blockquotes for definitions or important notes

#### Completeness
- Each section must be comprehensive and detailed
- Include specific numbers, thresholds, and limits
- Provide concrete examples for each feature
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

#### Accuracy
- Align with existing implementation in the codebase
- Reference actual database tables and API endpoints
- Use correct technical terminology
- Ensure consistency across all sections

### Deliverable

Create a single Markdown file: `kilocode_points_system_spec.md`

The file should be:
- ✅ Spec Kit compliant (all 16 sections)
- ✅ Comprehensive (covering all required features)
- ✅ Accurate (aligned with existing implementation)
- ✅ Professional (proper formatting and writing style)
- ✅ Ready for review and approval

### Reference Materials

Use the following existing files as reference:
- `/home/ubuntu/smart-ai-hub-latest/packages/core-service/src/services/point.service.ts`
- `/home/ubuntu/smart-ai-hub-latest/packages/core-service/src/controllers/point.controller.ts`
- `/home/ubuntu/smart-ai-hub-latest/packages/core-service/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `/home/ubuntu/upload/spec_example_good.md` (for Spec Kit format reference)

### Success Criteria

The specification is considered complete when:
- ✅ All 16 sections are present and comprehensive
- ✅ All required features are documented
- ✅ Technical details match existing implementation
- ✅ Writing style follows professional standards
- ✅ Document passes Spec Kit validation
- ✅ Compliance score ≥ 90%

## Instructions for Kilo Code

1. Read the existing implementation files to understand the current Points System
2. Read the Spec Kit example to understand the required format
3. Create the specification document with all 16 sections
4. Ensure each section is comprehensive and detailed
5. Use tables, diagrams (Mermaid), and examples where appropriate
6. Validate the document against Spec Kit standards
7. Save the file as `kilocode_points_system_spec.md` in the project root

## Notes

- This is a documentation task, not a coding task
- Do NOT modify any existing code
- Do NOT create new features
- ONLY create the specification document
- The document should reflect the EXISTING implementation
- Focus on clarity, completeness, and compliance with Spec Kit standards

## Output

Please create the specification document and confirm when complete. The document should be ready for review and approval by the product team.
